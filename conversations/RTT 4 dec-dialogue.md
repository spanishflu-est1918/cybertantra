## Dialogue


**Skyler** [0:00] 
Howdy.

**Gorka** [0:00] 
Howdy.

**Skyler** [0:01] 
Did you get that picture?

**Gorka** [0:02] 
Yes, I did. What the fuck?

**Skyler** [0:05] 
Yeah.
[0:08] I wanted to send that to you. That is the Indian form of Hermes or the equivalency. The closest equivalency.

**Gorka** [0:20] 
I sent you yesterday a video, and it's not here.

**Skyler** [0:25] 
Yeah, I don't remember getting a video.

**Gorka** [0:27] 
I went to the theater and I just looked up and literally above me was, like, a painting of Hermes, like.

**Skyler** [0:37] 
Looking at me like this.

**Gorka** [0:40] 
Like, I went into the theater and just. I took my spot and I was like, oh, this is a very nice theater. I look up and there's the guy with the. With the little petassos and the talaria. Everything, caduceus. Everything.

**Skyler** [0:55] 
That's beautiful.

**Gorka** [0:56] 
It didn't say, I have a video. I gotta send it to you.

**Skyler** [0:59] 
Yeah, send that to me. Yeah. You're. You're in his. You're under his care.

**Gorka** [1:05] 
I don't know. This morning I. I was convinced that he didn't like me or something.

**Skyler** [1:10] 
Really? Why is that? I don't know.

**Gorka** [1:12] 
I had the feeling. I was very gloomy this morning. I'm not sleeping very well.

**Skyler** [1:19] 
So.
[1:21] Your mood, you felt a little bit like you might have upset him?

**Gorka** [1:26] 
Yeah, I was gloomy. Yesterday I went to the theater because I was going to stay here while my parents went to the theater. And I already had a plan made in my head to purchase alcohol. And then I decided to ask my mother to go instead of her to the theater because she didn't want to go.

**Skyler** [1:46] 
So.

**Gorka** [1:46] 
So at least I made that choice. But I think that put me in a bad mood. You know.

**Skyler** [1:53] 
Choosing. Even considering choosing the algo.

**Gorka** [1:56] 
Yeah.

**Skyler** [1:59] 
Yeah.

**Gorka** [2:00] 
I'm not out of the woods yet.

**Skyler** [2:04] 
No, but.
[2:07] You just. Let me get this straight. You chose to go to the theater instead of getting alcohol?

**Gorka** [2:14] 
Yes, I did.

**Skyler** [2:15] 
And then when you sat down, you looked up and Hermes was staring at you.

**Gorka** [2:20] 
Yes.

**Skyler** [2:22] 
So this is a sign that you made the right decision. So, in fact, I would say that he's. He's happy with you, but he's also watching to make sure you don't make the. The mistake of falling off to the wayside because you made yourself a representative of that God. When you're practicing bhakti, you say, I am a devotee of Hermes, then you are representing Hermes in the world. So your actions shine on him. And if you misrepresent him, then you'll have to suffer the consequences of that. Right.

**Gorka** [3:02] 
Give me a sec because I'm trying to record the call and I want to know where the microphone is. On the iPhone.
[3:13] Is it up or is it down?

**Skyler** [3:16] 
It's down.

**Gorka** [3:17] 
Is it down? Right? Yes, it's on the charging. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Okay. I got a bunch of things to go through before.

**Skyler** [3:26] 
Wonderful.

**Gorka** [3:30] 
Yeah. Where do you want to start?

**Skyler** [3:31] 
I'm excited for it.

**Gorka** [3:36] 
Where do you want to start?

**Skyler** [3:39] 
Okay, so let's start with a review of your practice experience over the last week. And you can just make it short, and then we'll. And then we'll go from there.

**Gorka** [3:51] 
Well, I gotta tell you, it was fantastic. It was great. Well, my practice. Well, I've been doing the Diana daily and I've been doing the.
[4:04] The sleep yoga invocation. I don't know how to call it.

**Skyler** [4:09] 
Yoga sleep?

**Gorka** [4:11] 
No, the. The. The one that you sent me. So reciting that and doing visualization. I'm getting pretty good at visualization.

**Skyler** [4:20] 
Wonderful.

**Gorka** [4:21] 
I really do. Like, I can. Before, there was like something in my mind, something in my head that would.
[4:30] I think this is important to tell you. So imagine I want to see myself doing a kick flip in my head. Right.
[4:38] So instead of doing a kick flip, something in my head would stop the skateboard midway. Just pull it to the other side.

**Skyler** [4:50] 
Ah, yes.

**Gorka** [4:51] 
I don't know what that.

**Skyler** [4:52] 
I know what you're talking about.

**Gorka** [4:53] 
Do you?

**Skyler** [4:54] 
Yeah.
[4:58] Or would you talk about that? Let me make a note of that real quick so we can come back to that. Okay.

**Gorka** [5:03] 
So I'm getting very. I'm getting pretty well, when I'm in. In between sleep and wake. Waking state. Is that like Torah state?

**Skyler** [5:13] 
Yes.

**Gorka** [5:14] 
When I'm in that state.

**Skyler** [5:16] 
Yes. That's basically the Torah state. That's how it's defined. Yeah.

**Gorka** [5:22] 
When I'm in that state, I'm a God of visualization. I can do anything. I can also compose symphonies in my head, but outside, in, like in normal life.
[5:32] Only after all those months kind of staying in bed while hungover and just going through killing people in my head, basically, I've gotten kind of good at it and now I can feel it when I'm doing the Diana.
[5:50] I really can't see it. I can see the things. I can see the caduceus. I can see the liar, I can see the clamis. And I can feel the presence as well. Not only the visualization. It's like if in subtle space, something is actually attached to me as a prop, you know?

**Skyler** [6:06] 
Yes. Yeah, that part is very good.

**Gorka** [6:10] 
But I haven't really been doing Trataka or anything else because I just don't find when to do it. So we gotta talk about that. Maybe make another note, because you gotta help me find some time for meditation. Or maybe it's okay in this, at this point that I can't really.
[6:30] Do that because I spend all day working, Basically.

**Skyler** [6:34] 
Yeah.

**Gorka** [6:35] 
Then I told you that I was doing this application, right? That this app.

**Skyler** [6:39] 
Yes.

**Gorka** [6:39] 
Well, I never connected it to Hermes until now because it's actually an app for multitasking and for, like, going across domains and just not losing.
[6:50] Like, fighting the cognitive overload of changing from studying yoga to making a song, to doing, like, hardcore coding with agents or whatever. So that's what the app is about.
[7:03] Okay. And I just realized that it's also kind of like a related to this.
[7:12] I realized this, like, two days ago. I never thought of telling you about it because it's, like, really techy stuff. But it's for that the point is for multitasking, you know?

**Skyler** [7:22] 
That's beautiful. Yeah. Certainly within the realm. Hermes, definitely. Yeah. Flying from one place to the next, managing all of these connections. Yes. Then very good.

**Gorka** [7:35] 
The research. I got to talk to you about that.
[7:39] I was kind of procrastinating because I didn't know how to do it. I would, like, stare for a bit at the altar, like a digital Hermes altar, or just read something on Reddit, on the Hermes subreddit, or do something like that. But I was like, what? Like, where do I start to do this? So you know what I did? I started a conversation with Claude, the agent. And you know that I have the cyber tantra guru bot, right?

**Skyler** [8:10] 
Yes.

**Gorka** [8:11] 
So I have it connected to the chat. It's like, imagine I'm talking to Chat GPT. But it's like, much more intelligent, Claude, and much more empathetic. Let's say he understands what you're trying to say. So I gave him that. And I was like, all right, Claude, I want to start worshiping Hermes, and my goal is to make a Diana. Do you know what Adiana is? And he says. He goes like, no. And I say like, okay, ask.
[8:41] Digital Skyler or whatever. And then he asks him, comes back and he says, oh, okay. So it's a tantric thing. And he's like, do you do tantra or something? And I'm like, yes, I did this and this. Read what the right hand path is. Read what the left hand path is. And he's like, oh, okay. Wow, that's cool. And what do you know? Like, what about Hermes? What do you want to know? And so I upload some books to him, and then I gave him The Reddit things and like a bunch of links. And then I made him kind of interrogate me on what I am interested is that or what do I resonate with regarding Hermes? You know? And so it started like a Socratic conversation of sorts, and it was incredible. And I. I got the entire thing. Like, I understood why I like him, since when I like him.
[9:34] All this stuff about my parents naming me that and, and, and I gave him my astrological chart and everything. And it just makes sense to me now. And I got like a digital body there where I'm like, what should I do today? And he's like, oh, why don't you read this article? Fucking glorious.

**Skyler** [9:52] 
So that's wonderful in there.

**Gorka** [9:55] 
I had a. Like, just. Just to imagine this level. So he's like, what do. What are you doing right now to worship? And I'm like, okay, I will say like one time great. Two times great, three times great. Hail Hermes Trismegistus or whatever. And he's like, oh, so Trismegistus, okay. And he knows about that. And he's like, but what do you like when you say one time great? Like, what do you mean? Like, what are you thinking about? And I immediately jumped to, I think it's just body, mind and spirit. And he said like something like, oh, that's like the Greek neoma. And I remembered the tetra part self.
[10:35] Of course you remember. And I was like, so he should be like four times great, not three times great.

**Skyler** [10:42] 
So I made that great.

**Gorka** [10:44] 
I gave him like a new epithet. Now.
[10:48] This is this kind of thing.

**Skyler** [10:50] 
That's. That's incredible. Actually, I want to talk to you about that today as well. There's a man. There's a lot to cover. Hopefully we can get through all of it. We'll get through as much as we can.
[11:01] That's incredible.

**Gorka** [11:02] 
It was a lot of fun. And I have the Diana, and I'm really happy. I've been. I'm still editing it every day.
[11:11] But I think it's pretty powerful.

**Skyler** [11:13] 
It's beautiful.

**Gorka** [11:14] 
I love it.

**Skyler** [11:15] 
I love what you've written. Yeah, it's a very, very powerful invocation, very powerful prayer. I love it. And you're going to be expanding upon it too, so. Okay. Is there anything else you wanted to mention before we start diving into all this?

**Gorka** [11:37] 
I have to talk to you about a couple things outside the practice. Maybe we do that. We reserve like four minutes towards the end or something.
[11:45] Five minutes.
[11:48] Let me see.

**Skyler** [11:49] 
I'll make sure we have time.

**Gorka** [11:51] 
I.

**Skyler** [11:51] 
For that.

**Gorka** [11:52] 
I have to tell you that the tongue stuff is not really working yet. I always remember after, and I think it's because I'm not doing any trataka itself doing it.
[12:04] But yesterday was amazing because I. Because I was able to express my fears about Europe and provoking Russia into a war and then blaming Russia to my father, who's like this staunch Ukraine supporter. And we just talked about it and then we looked at each other like, why is nobody shouting right now?

**Skyler** [12:26] 
Yeah.
[12:28] That'S wonderful.

**Gorka** [12:29] 
My father is.

**Skyler** [12:32] 
Beginning to receive a boon of improved communication. That's wonderful.

**Gorka** [12:38] 
That's what I was going to say. Yesterday's play was all about communication, by the way.

**Skyler** [12:44] 
It was. What play did you see?

**Gorka** [12:46] 
It was a. A woman who's like a cleaner. Like a very low class, kind of like chaff cleaner of the. There's. There's this. There's this institution in Spain called the Royal Academy of the Language, and it's all over Latin America as well. That is very important. So she cleans the books, and then all the books fall on her head. And suddenly she starts speaking, like, extremely properly and getting pissed off about people speaking improperly. And so her family leaves her and she has no friends anymore, and she goes to this therapy session. That's what the play was about.

**Skyler** [13:23] 
That's actually ridiculously synchronous, isn't it? Yeah, yeah.
[13:32] That'S. That's. That's amazing. Wow. Okay, so you're 100 within the mystery of Hermes now. You're. You're deep into the. Into the hermetic practice here. That's wonderful. Okay, so let's. I'm gonna go through this list and we're gonna try and get through as much of this as we can. And I'm gonna leave. Let's leave about 10 minutes at the end for discussing.

**Gorka** [14:02] 
Okay.

**Skyler** [14:02] 
The. The other things. Okay. First off, the practice that you're engaged with at night, visualizing the throne room, visualizing that you're sleeping on the throne, resting on a sun cushion or a moon cushion. Did you notice a difference with the sun cushion or the moon cushion in your sleep?

**Gorka** [14:23] 
Well, the problem that I'm having is that I'm having two light of sleep yet, so.
[14:30] It'S really bad. I'm not sleeping at all. Like, the maximum that I manage to sleep in single go is like five hours.
[14:40] For the past two or three weeks. So I'm really grumpy and I'm kind of. Well, today I'm a little better and I need to talk to you about that as well. Because first I realized. Well, my mother realized it smells like eucalyptus in here. And it was the. Like, the. The elixir is, you know, is in the room, and it was smelling elixir, and I don't think that's a great idea. You know?

**Skyler** [15:09] 
What is your concern about the elixir?

**Gorka** [15:12] 
That it wakes me up?

**Skyler** [15:16] 
Yeah. It's extremely stimulating. Yeah.

**Gorka** [15:18] 
So I'm sleeping. I was sleeping, like, next to the elixir. So that might have something to do with it. The other thing is that I hadn't. I hadn't masturbated for, like, a month.
[15:32] That's the other thing. And the other day, I don't know why I did it. And then I just fell asleep in the afternoon and just slept for, like, four hours. So that might have something to do with it as well, but I'm not sleeping well in general. Like, I need something, and I know that I'm doing the Hermes thing, but maybe like a yoga nidra or something.

**Skyler** [15:52] 
Yeah, so you need a counterbalance force to Hermes. Okay. Hermes is your primary deity, but that doesn't mean that you will be ignoring the other gods on Olympus.

**Gorka** [16:11] 
What about Venus?

**Skyler** [16:13] 
Venus is good. And I do have yoga nidra to.

**Gorka** [16:17] 
Venus, because I have something, apparently in my chart. There's something on Venus.
[16:25] Is there?

**Skyler** [16:26] 
I can't remember what. What was your Venus in?

**Gorka** [16:30] 
Let me ask, because I don't remember.
[16:37] What did you tell me.
[16:41] About my chart? And.
[16:46] Yeah, and then I listened to Holtz's Venus, and I was like, oh, I felt that as well. So maybe that's, like, another thing.

**Skyler** [16:56] 
Yeah. So.
[17:01] The Venus.

**Gorka** [17:03] 
Gemini. Venus in Gemini, retrograde in the 12th house. So along with your son and Mercury, Venus is part of your triple Gemini stellium. But critically, both Mercury and Venus are sitting in your 12th house, the house of hidden things. The unconscious spiritual practice, mystical experience, the liminal space between worlds. So your 12th house is Mercury ruled, contains Mercury himself, dignified in home sign, and contains Venus also in Gemini. And Venus in the 12th suggests love and beauty, blah, blah, blah.

**Skyler** [17:35] 
The 12th house is.
[17:39] The Ajna house.

**Gorka** [17:41] 
Yes.

**Skyler** [17:42] 
So, yes.
[17:46] So.
[17:49] Basically, you have a very strong natural connection to the. You have a very strong natural connection to the supernatural expression of Mercury, meaning that you can draw Mercury from the supernatural into the natural world.
[18:10] You have a strong link between those two things, which is evident in your practice, because look at what's happening. Look at all of the things that are being generated in your physical environment. There was no coincidence that you were sitting in theater looking up and saw Hermes Staring down at you.

**Gorka** [18:27] 
That was kind of insane.

**Skyler** [18:28] 
No coincidence.
[18:30] So, yeah, this is an example of you tapping into subtle space from your work with Hermes. And it's going to increase your psychic power. Now.
[18:44] We need a counterbalance to that for when the stimulation of the spirit in the mind becomes too intense. So there are two options that I see. One is Aphrodite or Venus. The other is Dionysus.

**Gorka** [19:02] 
Oh.
[19:05] I kind of like Dionysus too.

**Skyler** [19:08] 
Dionysus is great.
[19:11] So both.
[19:15] Do you prefer. Okay, do you prefer the Greek or the. Or the Roman expression? At this point?

**Gorka** [19:24] 
I like the Greek more the Greek.

**Skyler** [19:27] 
Okay, so Aphrodite. Aphrodite we would associate with relationships and the anahata.
[19:38] But she also has a strong association with the Svadistana. And.
[19:45] And she has a strong association with Manipur as well, being the rising, the goddess of the dawn. The rising goddess. So.
[19:57] I think.
[19:59] In your astrological chart, we would say that your Venus placement has a lot to do with how you express the spadastana.

**Gorka** [20:07] 
Okay, so, yeah, I was a lover boy.

**Skyler** [20:13] 
Yeah. Right. And your.
[20:17] Your expression of the spadastana is intimately tied with Hermes.
[20:25] Now.
[20:27] That would mean that when you're accessing the opposing point to the ajna, so you're accessing the svadhisthana for balance, in order to allow yourself to rest. So what's happening is that you're a bird all day long, flying from place to place, soaring constantly. But at night, you need to roost. You need to come down into your nest, and you need to be able to sleep soundly. And so what's required is the sleeping conditions need to be directed towards.
[21:09] Traveling to a realm of consciousness that allows you to experience deeper sleep. So so far, you've been going to sleep in the throne room of Hermes.
[21:25] Now, the throne room of Hermes is constantly filled with fluttering activity. You're. You're up in the sky, there's movement, there's a sense of flying. So it's not really the best place to sleep.
[21:41] And.
[21:43] When you're going to sleep and you're visualizing yourself in this throne room, you have access to all of these doorways, right?

**Gorka** [21:51] 
Yeah, but I haven't crossed anything yet.

**Skyler** [21:55] 
Well, it's time to open one of those doors.
[22:00] So those doors are pathways to different palaces of the gods.
[22:09] And we need to choose what palace you'll enter into in order to rest. So you're not going to sleep at home. You're going to go somewhere else to sleep.

**Gorka** [22:18] 
Oh, shit.

**Skyler** [22:19] 
Okay, so you're going to Start your meditation.
[22:23] In the throne room of Hermes. But you're going to end your nightly meditation now visualizing a different throne room. So I say that you should go to Dionysus. And the reason why I say you should go to Dionysus is because Dionysus was born in the kingdom of dreams.
[22:47] Nyasa. Okay. And. Sorry, Nysa, Niasa is a.
[22:56] Connected concept from Indian tradition. But Nysa, Nysa, you know that the.

**Gorka** [23:03] 
The, the only classical art, like visual art that actually, I said, that's kind of nice. It's one with Hermes, with the Dionysus baby.

**Skyler** [23:17] 
Yeah.
[23:19] That'S beautiful.

**Gorka** [23:21] 
Yes, I'll send it to you.

**Skyler** [23:22] 
So.

**Gorka** [23:23] 
And I actually talked to Claude about that. Like, that's the only one that actually resonated a bit that I didn't know why.

**Skyler** [23:29] 
Well, that's a connecting point. So you have this. On one side, you have this figure that's always flying, always up in the clouds, always moving. And then you have another figure who's very leisurely. Leisurely. He's laying around, he's getting drunk, he's, you know, eating a lot of food. Now here's the. Here's the risk with going into the palace of Dionysus. When you go there, there's going to be many temptations. Okay. And one of the reasons why it's hard for you to rest is that when you go into the Svada Stana and you interact with the Dionysian inside of you, there's a tendency towards over consumption.

**Gorka** [24:08] 
Yeah, that is true.

**Skyler** [24:12] 
So you have to be able to rest in the palace of Dionysus without engaging in all of the libations.

**Gorka** [24:22] 
Maybe if I solve that in my dreams.

**Skyler** [24:28] 
If you solve it in your dreams, you'll solve it in the physical world. That's one of the principles of Yoga Nidra. We're doing sleep magic right now, and Nyse is deeply associated with sleep magic. Have you ever read the article that I wrote on Yoga Nidra and sleep magic?

**Gorka** [24:50] 
Nope.

**Skyler** [24:51] 
It's one of the first things I ever published. Okay.
[24:57] And I want you to. To read that it's in the Discord.
[25:05] But it's also on the Patreon. Okay, let me.

**Gorka** [25:10] 
So, yeah, I'll try to find it in Discord while we're talking.

**Skyler** [25:13] 
Great. I think it should be under meditation or. Oh, you know what? I think it's under the Yoga Nidra section. If you, if you check there.

**Gorka** [25:23] 
Okay.

**Skyler** [25:26] 
Now.
[25:30] Okay. It's very clear to me, Gorka, that you have some unfinished business with Dionysus. Yeah, it's pretty clear you have something.

**Gorka** [25:38] 
To learn from it because that's when everything went off the rails. Right hand path.

**Skyler** [25:44] 
Yeah.
[25:47] Yes. So there's some unfinished business there. But you have Hermes on your side, which means that you don't necessarily have to be tied down to that condition. Now, there's so many examples within Greek mythology of heroes going into a specific realm where they could have been held there for eternity, but they found a way to learn the lesson they needed to learn and then move on. One of the best examples of that is Odysseus. Odysseus is constantly challenged to escape.
[26:21] Various locations. He gets trapped on the island of the Cyclops. He gets trapped in. Yep, that's it.

**Gorka** [26:29] 
That's the one, right? Okay.

**Skyler** [26:31] 
Yes, that's it. Sleep magic. He gets tempted by the Sirens, so there's all this temptation. But he's able to.
[26:45] Set the necessary.
[26:48] Rituals in place. Like, for example, tying. Having his men tie him to the mast of his ship to be able to endure these challenges. So we need to prepare you for entering into the throne room of Dionysus so that you do not engage in any of the activities there other than to sleep. If you go there to sleep and you just intend to sleep and you, you know, because Dionysus will say, well, just, why don't you just have one drink before you go to bed? It'll help you sleep.
[27:28] But you have to be ready to say, no, thank you. The warm bed is enough for me.

**Gorka** [27:37] 
Take that down.

**Skyler** [27:42] 
So basically, here's how this is going to work. You're going to utilize your meditations before bed as a way to communicate with the gods. Okay? So I want you to go through the whole process of visualizing the throne room of Hermes. You're laying in bed, you're visualizing all these things, and then I want you to walk through the doorway of Dionysus. So I want you to imagine this beautiful oak stained doorway, this dark stained oak doorway. And engraved in the door are grapevines, beautiful grapes. There's maenads dancing in a circle. There's images of Pan and of the orgia, and there's this chalice, this cup with three dots, the sigil Dionysus. Let me show you.

**Gorka** [28:47] 
Oh, nice.

**Skyler** [28:49] 
That is on the doorway.

**Gorka** [28:53] 
Okay.
[28:58] Go ahead.

**Skyler** [28:59] 
I visited Dionysus a few times.
[29:06] So.
[29:11] Yeah, on the, on the doorway you'll see this image of this cup. Grapes. And then I want you to walk through the door and I want you to travel to visit Dionysus, visit the maenads, visit Pan and I want you talk with them, and I want you to explain to them. And this is all within this meditative exercise. So you're generating this throne room, and then you're seeing yourself walk through this door, and then you're seeing these gods. And I want you to have a conversation with them in subtle space. I want you to say, I'm here for sleep. I'm here for deep, restful sleep. And I know that you can give it to me. I want to go to Nyse. I want to go to the kingdom of dreams and have deep, restful sleep. And I don't want to participate in the orgia. Okay, now there's going to be all activity. What's that?

**Gorka** [30:07] 
What a party pooper.
[30:10] Yeah, they'll be like, yeah, yeah, it's over there.

**Skyler** [30:14] 
Yeah, right, yeah, go over there.
[30:18] Down.

**Gorka** [30:18] 
The hole and to the left.

**Skyler** [30:20] 
Yeah, another one.
[30:26] So I want you to. In preparation for this meditation, I want you to do some research into Dionysus. I want you to read about the maenads. I want you to read about the orgia so that whenever you go to this place, you can properly picture these images in subtle space.

**Gorka** [30:42] 
So what do you want me to do again?

**Skyler** [30:45] 
What's that?

**Gorka** [30:46] 
What do you want me to do again? Say it again.

**Skyler** [30:50] 
Yeah. So I want you to start with the visualization of the throne room of Hermes as you have been visualizing it every night.
[31:01] I want you to see yourself walk to the door that I described, that oak door with all of the engravings. This is the doorway to the palace of Dionysus. I want you to open the door, walk through it, enter into the throne room of Dionysus. And I want you to see all of the festivities occurring, all the drinking, all the music, all the sex, all of the violence, all of the partying. Basically, I want you to visualize all of this. And I want you to talk to Dionysus, and I want you to say, I'm here for deep, restful sleep. I know that you are the king of Nyse and that you can give the most restful sleep. Please bring this sleep to me.
[31:55] And he. I want you to see the moment of temptation where he says to you, you could drink, you could join in with all of this revelry. You could have fun with us, and then exhaust yourself, and then you'll sleep. And I want you to say, no, the warm bed in the kingdom of dreams is enough for me. And it is what I need more than anything. Okay? And explain this to him, because you're acting in the Role of Hermes now. So you have to be able to travel to his palace without being trapped there. You have to. You have to say, not today. Maybe another day, but not today. I sleep.

**Gorka** [32:37] 
Can I do it another day?

**Skyler** [32:43] 
Yeah. So the goal is that at some point you'll be able to go into the palace of Dionysus and enjoy all of those things, but from a place of power, because all of these gods will tempt you. Dionysus will try to get you drunk. Zeus will try and make you egotistical. Aphrodite will try to have sex with you.
[33:07] Demeter will try to poison your mind and make you be in a state of delirium. All of these gods will test you. Okay? Hermes is testing you too. Hermes is seeing if you'll just continue to exhaust yourself with. With mental stimulation and activity until you end up, like.
[33:34] I just blanked on the name.
[33:39] The God. Or not the God, but the mortal who flies too close to the sun.

**Gorka** [33:45] 
Oh, yeah. Icarus.

**Skyler** [33:47] 
Icarus. Yeah. So, yeah, he's testing you. He's trying to make you like Icarus and bring you too close to the sun so that you'll burn up.

**Gorka** [33:57] 
So is it okay, though, if I wake up at, like, 6 or 6:30 and I'm kind of. Why would I stay in bed? Just wake up and do stuff? Is that okay?

**Skyler** [34:08] 
Yeah, as long as you're feeling rested enough. There's no. There's nothing wrong with that.

**Gorka** [34:15] 
Well, the problem is I don't. But I also, like. I know that staying in bed is not gonna be.

**Skyler** [34:23] 
Are you taking your midday naps?

**Gorka** [34:25] 
Yeah.

**Skyler** [34:28] 
And you're still not feeling rested?

**Gorka** [34:30] 
No, I'm fine.
[34:33] I'm fine. At this time of the day? In the morning, it's kind of heavy.

**Skyler** [34:39] 
Oh, I see. Okay. Well, I think what's happening is that the main thing is not even sleep at this point. The main thing is that this is a call for you to visit Dionysus so that you can reconcile these consumptive tendencies that may have held you back in the past.

**Gorka** [34:56] 
Okay?

**Skyler** [34:59] 
So that's the main thing we need to focus on, is reconciling that and fixing your relationship with Dionysus. Because Dionysus will welcome you into his throne room, he'll welcome you into his kingdom, and you'll be able to enjoy everything he has to offer. But you want to do it from a place of Dharma. You want to do it from a place of command and not under the spell of Dionysus. And his is a very potent spell. He's.
[35:33] He's a master of divine madness. So you have to be a little bit careful. But if you prepare yourself, if you go into the ritual exercise knowing that when you get to the palace, you have decided, I am going to say this, I'm going to. I'm not going to participate in all of this, all of these spells. And that's how you have to look at them. They're entire enticements, their spells, to bind you. Okay. Know that you're not denying Dionysus forever. You're just saying, not today, and then you're returning.
[36:18] Okay, very good.
[36:21] Very good.
[36:25] Now I want to incorporate. Let's do one more exercise.
[36:33] I want to incorporate one more exercise called the Yoga of Rising.

**Gorka** [36:37] 
Yoga of Rising?

**Skyler** [36:39] 
Yeah.

**Gorka** [36:39] 
Okay.

**Skyler** [36:46] 
So this is the.
[36:49] Partner ritual to the Yoga of sleep. So all yoga nidra exercise, you have a rising component as well.
[36:58] There's a very simple example of this. Whenever I have guided you in yoga nidra, and I say.
[37:06] You are now becoming aware of your physical body. You are now becoming aware of your physical surroundings. When you're ready, open your eyes. That's a very minute, very small expression of the Yoga of Rising. So the Yoga of Rising is.
[37:21] Tantrically designing your waking moment. Okay, so there's different ways you can do this, but basically you want to train yourself to enter into a visualization of waking up into the throne room of wherever you slept. Okay. And then experiencing jubilation at your waking. So, for example, if you wake up in the throne room of Dionysus, you'll visualize that you're surrounded by maenads and paths. Pan is playing his flute, and all of these figures are celebrating your waking and beckoning you on to rise with thumos and experience fire throughout the day. They're giving you energy. They're giving you whatever you need, the prana that you need to experience, the type of day that you need to experience. Okay, so they're celebrating your awakening. And I want you to. When you open your eyes, I want you to try to replace all of the mundane appearances. So if there's a clock on the wall, don't see it as a clock. See it as some great shield or. Or. Or bundle of grapes of Dionysus. I want you to place a psychic impression upon your entire room. So you're piercing the veil of the mundane world, and you're seeing a new world in subtle space. And you're seeing. Dionysus is smiling, you know, hungover. He spills his wine cup, and he's like, oh, you're Awake, you know, great. And he's clapping his hands and he's saying, you know, get up, get up. Come on, join us. We're having a great day today. All right? And then you're going to go out after that, and you're going to feel the rejuvenation of waking up to those conditions. Now, for some of my students, whenever they've done yoga of rising, I've recommended that if they're going to wake up at a specific time, to set an alarm where a specific song will play. Like, for example, if you were waking up in the temple of Hermes, you could hear host Mercury as soon as you wake up. And then you could visualize all of these angels flying around you, all of these beautiful figures in the sky flying around. You say it's time to get up.
[39:40] If you're waking up in the temple of Dionysus, maybe there's a particular song or chant or something like that that you would associate with Dionysus.

**Gorka** [39:52] 
Yeah. We have a problem, though. I hate alarms.

**Skyler** [39:56] 
Yeah. So you don't have to set an alarm. It's not a necessary component of the practice.
[40:03] It's enough to just remember to visualize.
[40:09] Where you have awoken and. And who populates that.

**Gorka** [40:14] 
Is there a Dionysus holds part or no?

**Skyler** [40:20] 
So the.
[40:25] The planet that I would most associate with Dionysus.
[40:32] Because there's not a direct.
[40:37] There's not a direct equivalent in the Holst piece. But I would say Venus is probably the closest thing for what you're trying to access, because you're trying to access that more Svadistana type.
[40:55] Environment. So one thing you could do is when you wake up, play the song.

**Gorka** [41:01] 
Okay.

**Skyler** [41:02] 
And listen to it and then have all this visualization of all these things around you, you know? You seen a Clockwork Orange?

**Gorka** [41:10] 
Yes, of course.

**Skyler** [41:12] 
You know how at the end of the film, Alex is surrounded by all of these people, the reporters and doctors and all that, but that's not what he's seeing, Right.

**Gorka** [41:21] 
What is he saying? Like violence.

**Skyler** [41:24] 
Watch that scene again. Look it up.

**Gorka** [41:26] 
Isn't he saying he's seen. He's seeing, like, people having sex and like that?

**Skyler** [41:29] 
Yeah, yeah. And like, he's. He's got, like, blood running down his cheeks and stuff.

**Gorka** [41:36] 
Yeah.

**Skyler** [41:37] 
I don't remember.

**Gorka** [41:37] 
Something.

**Skyler** [41:39] 
Yeah. So that's basically it. You know, regardless of. Of where you're waking up in the physical world, you're tapping into another dimension upon waking, and that's helping to influence your waking hours. So that's. I want you to practice that. So wherever you visualize going to sleep, if you're visualizing going to sleep in. In the temple of Dionysus, then wake up in the temple of Dionysus. If you're going to the temple of Aphrodite, then wake up in the temple of Aphrodite.

**Gorka** [42:11] 
Should I go back to Hermes room or no?

**Skyler** [42:15] 
Nope. Not until you go to sleep again.

**Gorka** [42:17] 
Okay.

**Skyler** [42:19] 
Yeah.

**Gorka** [42:21] 
Now, Hermes room is quite cold to me, by the way. It's like he doesn't.

**Skyler** [42:26] 
Quite cold. Yes, it is. Yeah. Because you're way up in the sky.

**Gorka** [42:30] 
It's like. Yeah. I imagine it's very close to what I imagine as my. As my.
[42:36] How do you call it, the visualization exercise that we did where you imagine like a room.

**Skyler** [42:44] 
Oh, you're inner sanctum.

**Gorka** [42:45] 
It's very close to that. It's like a dome.

**Skyler** [42:47] 
Yeah.

**Gorka** [42:48] 
With like a lot of windows and it's just like in the middle of the sky and it's like wind outside the room.

**Skyler** [42:56] 
Beautiful. Yeah. Which is very stimulating to the mind. And it can put you in a particular satvic state. That's not necessarily.
[43:07] Doesn'T necessarily promote the kind of sleep that you're looking for. You're looking more for an earthy sleep.

**Gorka** [43:13] 
Yeah.

**Skyler** [43:14] 
Yeah.

**Gorka** [43:15] 
It's not cozy, I can tell you that.

**Skyler** [43:17] 
Yeah. So with the elixir, and then after this, we'll talk about what's going on, the other things that are going on. But with the elixir.
[43:27] Keep the elixir in. In a particular area. Don't sleep with it next to you. Keep it on your altar. You know, altar space, if you have one. I know that you've been, you've been using a digital altar, but if you don't have a particular altar space, put the elixir away.
[43:46] Treat it like it is a potent magical object.

**Gorka** [43:49] 
Because I have it in the bathroom where all the oils are and stuff like that. It's just.

**Skyler** [43:54] 
I feel okay.

**Gorka** [43:55] 
I feel it's okay over there.

**Skyler** [43:57] 
Okay, good. Then keep it there. And yeah, don't have it next to your bed now if you want to. So I actually have an oil here that is.
[44:10] Very similar to an oil of. It's actually the one that I showed you before. It's. That oil was crafted by a witch in Missouri and she used very similar oils in that as.
[44:29] This oil of Dionysus, which she used pear oil and wine.
[44:37] White wine and pear oil. So. But that's, you know, if you're going to sleep smelling wine. Okay. That will help to ground you just the smell of the wine and the pears and the grapes and olive, all those things will be very cozy, but they're temptations as well, so. Yeah. But if you, at some point, I would like you to make an elixir for Dionysus as well. If you want to do it this week, you can do it this week, or we can wait till next week. But I'm gonna, I'm just gonna tell you real quick the ingredients. So use.
[45:21] You can use pear, you can use grape.
[45:28] Yep. Wine.

**Gorka** [45:31] 
What kind of wine?

**Skyler** [45:34] 
So.
[45:37] You can use any kind of wine you'd like. Whatever, Whatever scent of wine. So the red wine is going to be more of a.
[45:50] Just like an earthier.
[45:54] Scent. And then the white wine is going to be a little bit lighter, more like the, the misty quality of Dionysus. But use, Use some kind of wine. I would recommend probably the red wine. Okay.
[46:12] And there's another thing.
[46:17] Oh, you can use olive oil as well.

**Gorka** [46:19] 
Yeah, I have amazing olive oil.

**Skyler** [46:23] 
Okay.
[46:26] So if you combine some of those ingredients together, and if you also have.
[46:34] Chocolate, chocolate, cocoa.

**Gorka** [46:40] 
Okay.

**Skyler** [46:44] 
Combine that together, and then you can keep that by your bed, and you can, you can apply some of that before you go to sleep, and it will help you take. To relax and have a feeling of warmth and drift away to go see Dionysus.

**Gorka** [47:01] 
Okay, I will do that.

**Skyler** [47:03] 
Great. Wearing the wine instead of drinking it is a pretty powerful thing to achieve.
[47:12] Someday you'll be able to drink it again from a different perspective, but for now, you can wear it.

**Gorka** [47:19] 
Maybe instead of drinking it, I should pour it on myself.

**Skyler** [47:23] 
You could do that as well.
[47:28] Okay, Gorka, before we run out of time, tell me what else is going on.

**Gorka** [47:32] 
Okay. Yeah, no, not much. I wanted to discuss a couple things. I wanted to see if you would be up for this month especially, and maybe next month as well, to do double again.

**Skyler** [47:46] 
Yeah.

**Gorka** [47:46] 
Because I find it was okay. Like, when I'm manic, it's great. But I, I, I am. I'm like, in a very fragile state. I think I need a little bit more support right now.

**Skyler** [47:59] 
Okay.

**Gorka** [48:00] 
And also, I'm kind of doubling down on practice, so that would be great. But we would also have some more time for other stuff. Just.

**Skyler** [48:08] 
Yeah. Okay.

**Gorka** [48:08] 
Because it feels a bit rushed to me right now, and if we did well.

**Skyler** [48:12] 
Yeah. Because there's a lot to get through. I mean, I still have a lot that I need to discuss with you. Rest from what you brought up today. A whole lot. So. Yeah. If you're okay. If you're okay. With that. If you're okay with, you know, the.
[48:29] The amount of tuition for the double calls and everything, then I'm. Then I'm good with that.

**Gorka** [48:34] 
Yeah, let's do it.

**Skyler** [48:35] 
I can make. So let me. What days you want the earliest time on Tuesday and Thursday we can do.

**Gorka** [48:44] 
Maybe Tuesday, Friday, I don't know.

**Skyler** [48:47] 
Tuesday, Friday.
[48:51] I will block out those times for you.

**Gorka** [48:54] 
Could you do.

**Skyler** [48:55] 
And no one else. No one else will get them. Okay.

**Gorka** [48:57] 
Could you do one hour earlier or one hour earlier or is that impossible?

**Skyler** [49:02] 
Yeah, I'll do one hour earlier. Let's do that. Okay, we'll do. We'll do noon. So I'm going to open up those times and I was thinking about opening up that time anyway.
[49:16] Because I have. I was re. Reorganizing my schedule and I was thinking it might be good for me to start my calls at noon because a lot of people.

**Gorka** [49:29] 
For the Europores.

**Skyler** [49:31] 
Yeah, for the. For the. For the Europeans.
[49:35] For my people.

**Gorka** [49:36] 
For the Europores, we. We collect.

**Skyler** [49:38] 
Yeah.
[49:43] So yeah, we can do that.

**Gorka** [49:46] 
I'll send you 333 more and we can start next week maybe.

**Skyler** [49:51] 
Okay, sounds good, my friend.

**Gorka** [49:53] 
This time it's very good. Okay. As well. Let's. Let's see. Let's see. Because maybe this time is good to finish this.

**Skyler** [50:01] 
Well, I was considering opening up my time at noon anyway, like I said. So. Yeah.

**Gorka** [50:06] 
Okay.

**Skyler** [50:07] 
So that's. That's good. I need more time anyway because I have. Tyler is going to be returning to.
[50:15] More consistent. Like he's going to be returning to his old training.
[50:22] Soon. So.
[50:27] I'll need time for that as well. I have some people I want to open up time for. So. Yeah, that will be good. And then also I'm opening up. I want to open up my time to do consciousness analysis more for people who aren't in direct training or taking, you know, calls for.
[50:45] Very specific issues that need to be dealt with in people who might not be on a regular training schedule. So. Yeah, this is good.
[50:55] Okay. Gorka, do you. I've got three more minutes. Do you want to try to touch upon. Yeah, a couple more things.

**Gorka** [51:07] 
I gotta show you something.

**Skyler** [51:09] 
Yeah, let me see.

**Gorka** [51:10] 
I sent it to Ash, but I don't think she saw it. Oh yeah, she. She did see.
[51:16] Look, in the game you can reach a rampage state and then you will be. You remember the game, right?

**Skyler** [51:24] 
Yeah, of course.

**Gorka** [51:25] 
And then you will be tempted by 72 virgins. Look.

**Skyler** [51:33] 
Holy.

**Gorka** [51:37] 
You see it?

**Skyler** [51:40] 
That's amazing.

**Gorka** [51:41] 
I made. I made all those. And look at the. Look at the lines as well. It's amazing.

**Skyler** [51:49] 
Oh, my God, that's genius. That's hilarious.
[51:57] So did you. That. That is so.
[52:02] Funny.

**Gorka** [52:03] 
Yeah, I'm gonna play like, some Arab music in the background. Like some.

**Skyler** [52:11] 
Yeah, you should do like a trap remix.
[52:15] Of an Islamic prayer.

**Gorka** [52:16] 
Nice.

**Skyler** [52:17] 
Yeah, that's great for when the 72 virgins start flying around.

**Gorka** [52:23] 
We don't have much time, but I wanted to tell you that I'm killing the old Twitter account and I'm starting fresh because I'm. I just have too much emotional bias in that account and like, too many drunk, drunken rants and stuff like that. And I just want to start and see you.

**Skyler** [52:38] 
I get the. I get the feeling I know where you're coming from. Yeah.

**Gorka** [52:42] 
And I thought even, like, I have 600 followers, I'll tweet and nobody will like it. So who cares if I get like 10 followers and they give me a. Like each? That would be a difference, you know?

**Skyler** [52:53] 
So are you thinking about doing it.
[53:01] Anonymously?

**Gorka** [53:02] 
Yeah, they troll anonymous. Yeah, I already got the account, so I was. I was thinking of posting in the groups to get like a couple followers. Maybe there's people on Twitter. Maybe.

**Skyler** [53:14] 
Well, release the game. I would say to keep it as anonymous as possible.

**Gorka** [53:19] 
Even in here. Even in the.

**Skyler** [53:22] 
Just. Just as. Just. Just as a. Just as a rule, I have zero worry that you would. Anyone would cause any trouble for you in the school. But just as a general rule, I think it's good to occult this and make it into your own hermetic mystery of who the Spanish flu is.

**Gorka** [53:43] 
Yeah, that's much funnier, actually. And the last thing that I wanted to ask you is, is I want to revive the Twitter account. The yoga school Twitter account. So.

**Skyler** [53:53] 
Yes.

**Gorka** [53:54] 
Do you give me permission? Because right now with. With what I have and the guru and everything, like the digital guru and everything, I think I can just start.
[54:04] And I wanted to ask you, can I just do it, like, tomorrow I'll listen to, like, the MK Ultra lecture and just start writing on that, for example.

**Skyler** [54:14] 
Yeah, of course. So can you link me. Can you send me the post.
[54:22] That before you post it and I'll just give you the thumbs up?

**Gorka** [54:25] 
Yeah, sure.

**Skyler** [54:26] 
Okay. Okay, great. That'd be great. Gorko. That's awesome. Yes, That's a great idea.

**Gorka** [54:31] 
Okay, cool.

**Skyler** [54:35] 
So I'll make a note of that too. I'll be. I'll be checking every day to see throughout the day if you send me anything so I can give you thumbs up. We'll treat it like the. The Coliseum.

**Gorka** [54:47] 
Yeah.

**Skyler** [54:47] 
Okay. Yeah.

**Gorka** [54:49] 
But if I get, like, 10 thumbs up in a row, can I be independent and just do it at some point?

**Skyler** [54:55] 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I just want to, in the beginning, see how everything is flowing and see, you know, if I want to add anything to it, it's not that I think you would do a bad job. I just want. I want to be made aware of what.

**Gorka** [55:10] 
Yeah, yeah, of course. And do you have anything that you want me to do right now as, like, some. You know, this is something that I could explore there. For example.

**Skyler** [55:22] 
That talk that I just gave on what is consciousness is extremely important because I talk about consciousness all the time, and I don't. And I just defined it in that video. So that one would be a really good thing to start with.

**Gorka** [55:37] 
Is it in YouTube?

**Skyler** [55:38] 
Yeah, it's on YouTube.

**Gorka** [55:41] 
And I shouldn't connect the. The Spanish flu to RTD at all, right?

**Skyler** [55:47] 
Like, no, I would say keep yourself disconnected from any linking that could, you know, help people figure out who you are.

**Gorka** [55:55] 
Yep.

**Skyler** [55:57] 
Yeah.

**Gorka** [55:58] 
All right.

**Skyler** [55:58] 
Okay, Gorka, I've got to get going because I got another call now. But, yeah, I'm. I'm looking forward to the first post you send me. So, yeah, I'll. I'll be waiting and watching for it.

**Gorka** [56:09] 
All right. Thank you.

**Skyler** [56:11] 
All right.

**Gorka** [56:11] 
Oh, by the way, Herman, salute.

We're so back. I'm having fun in the calls again.

Hell, yeah. Great practicing, buddy. Yeah. I'm loving this. Okay, I'll speak to you soon, Gorka.
