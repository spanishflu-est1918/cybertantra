within Aryan myth one of the most important Concepts to understand is the cyclical nature of time now perception of time in modernity has changed quite a bit from what it was in the ancient world in the ancient world there was a recognition of time as a cyclical process and this is seen within the myths of various Aryan Traditions throughout the globe you could select say for example the Indian tradition and you could observe the Yugi cycle and you can begin to get a sense for how the ancient Aryans perceived time and how they related to time because one's relationship to time as a concept is very important in determining how that individual navigates the cosmos how they express their Dharma how they live their life in modernity we live with generally I say we I mean the global population generally lives with a concept of linear time and this bias towards linear time was built by the rise of the abrahamic religions which rely upon a def beginning and a definite end point of time now one of the major problems with linear time is that it is extremely limiting in that you do not have any concept of the infinite within linear time because you must have an ultimate end point and so you cannot reasonably exist within a framework of deification meaning everlasting life as is Promised in the abrahamic faiths because you would have to enter into a cyclical time scale if you affirm Infinity so Christians don't really believe in everlasting life because they believe in a definite end they believe in in a beginning and they believe in an end this is the occulted aspect of Yahweh Worship in that if you believe Yahweh created the universe created the cosmos and set Humanity on a course of progressive time you believe in the instate and the instate in its occulted form within yahwism is total submission to Yahweh it's being absorbed into Yahweh so that is the end that is the end of the self it is the prophecy and that is why progressivism and this uh hastening march to some endpoint can be seen within the culture even in so-called secular cultures which claim to be disconnected from the abrahamic Foundation nonetheless these cultures are still advancing progressively towards some endpoint and we see the wheels of Industry turning faster and life becoming faster and no one ever stops to just reflect on the infinite and it is this reflection upon the infinite that gives the Aryan tradition much of its essential character and so tonight we're going to talk about a a specific myth surrounding Gaia within the Greek tradition that gives us a very beautiful illustration of the cyclical nature of time so the ancient text that I have gathered much of this information from is hesiod's theog so the theoy provides us with sort of like a birth record an account of the life of the Gods going back to the most essential expression of the Gods within the Greek mythological account and So within the theog we have have very very ancient old deities described older than the present Pantheon that most people are aware of which includes Gods like Zeus Poseidon Hades Etc so in the theoy we have an account of Gaia Gaia is the Earth mother and her equivalent within the Indian tradition would be shaki so Gaia being the Earth mother she is born out of chaos now chaos is recognized as the differentiated state within the Greek tradition is specifically referred to as chaos and some of the presocratic philosophers specifically heraclitus argued that chaos was the Prime State now this is interesting because this is actually counter to the position that is held by um many modern philosophers in Aryan tradition specifically within the yogic tradition where the prime state is often presented as Brahma or the primordial being or the primordial Oneness also known as the monistic point this is also the monistic point this is also the prime state within the abrahamic Traditions it is Yahweh acting in the role of l in this primordial Oneness giving birth to differentiation but here we have heraclitis arguing that no it is chaos it is the differentiated state that is the prime state but recognition of One Prime State over the other whether it's the state of chaos or the state of uh oness in the monistic point this is a modern degeneration and heraclitus is actually uh an outlier within the ancient Greek culture because um in hess's description within the theoy of the relationship between Chaos and Order he describes the fact that chaos exists as a state between Earth Gaia and Tartarus so this is Tartarus is like the underworld or the Shadow and so we have within the account of the birth of Gaia within theoy the expansion of Gaia and Tartarus from chaos as well as Aeros who is is the god of love we have this expansion from chaos yet at the same time we have this description of chaos existing somewhere between the Earth and Tartarus or between Gaia and Tartarus okay so what that means is that within this account that is presented to us by hesiod there is no Prime State the Earth Tartarus chaos Order and Chaos existing simultaneously and this is quite interesting and this is why this myth is so beautiful because it gives us a very explicit yet still occulted presentation of the cyclical nature of time within the Aryan tradition so let's discuss the life of Gaia and see what the life of Gaia means in relation to our lives so Gaia gives birth and it's actually sort of like uh an Immaculate Conception uh she gives birth without having sex to pontis the Sea Ura the mountain and Uranus the sky and Uranus is a very important figure because here we have with Uranus the first example in the Greek tradition of the sky father or the Aryan patriarch now notice that we have here in this formation of the Gods we have guia representing the Earth so she is the foundation and her Consciousness would be represented by the muladar she is also shaki she gives birth to pontis the sea that is the spirit Ura the mountains so this is the inner fire and Uranus the sky this is the mind and and it's very interesting to consider that inner fire the Mind and Spirit are all given form in this age that is described Within theog by Gaia the Earth mother or Shakti so this is yet another description of the age of shaki so you could say if you're practicing within the Greek tradition you could say that the age of shaki is in fact the age of of GA and it gets even more complex but we're going to we're going to talk about that in just a moment so Gaia takes as her consort Uranus and she gives birth to the Titans the cyclopes and the Giants now this is quite interesting because here we have in this aspect of the myth the relationship between mind and body in the formation of a new Matrix so we have the conceptual element the contemplative element represented by excuse me represented by Uranus or the sky interacting with the Earth so Uranus provides the blueprint and Gaia provides the raw material for the creation of the Titans and the cyclopes and the Giants what we have here is the first Pantheon within the Greek tradition so these are the gods this is the old Pantheon before the pantheon that we know now with Zeus and Herod and all of those Gods within this Pantheon Uranus plays the role of the sky Father which is a very special role because he essentially acts as the the ruler of the Empire of the Gods he's the first example of this in the Greek tradition and as ruler of the Empire of the Gods Uranus falls into decadence he begins to fear the stability of his position and so he takes a specific action that ultimately leads to his downfall he takes the cyclopes and the hecaton curus the hecon curus are the uh Giants that have 50 heads and 100 arms and he places them within Gaia he hides them inside of her and she feels great pain this causes her immense pain now Uranus is acting out of fear he's acting out of the fear that he will lose his position as ruler of this first Pantheon of gods and he's willing to cause great pain to his consort Gaia in order to maintain his position what we see here is the rejection of shaky by the patriarch who has fallen into decadence and no longer has the strength to maintain a healthy relationship with the divine feminine there are so many examples of this not only within Aryan myth but also within recent history I'll give just a couple examples so we have within the Aryan tradition of the original manifestation of Yahweh in his Pantheon Yahweh rejecting the pan on so becoming fearful of his position of the stability of his position and then rejecting the divine feminine and assuming the role of the one true God and So within this tradition Yahweh was successful and this is why there is a hatred of Women Within abrahamic religion there is a suppression of the divine feminine because women represent Divine femininity they represent Gaia they represent Shakti and Shakti and Gaia are the greatest threats to the stability of a weakened patriarch if the patriarch loses his authority loses his ability to rule effectively the divine feminine urge towards chaos will lead to the destruction of that Empire and yanus was not willing to give up his Empire neither was Yahweh another example would be Adolf Hitler Adolf Hitler is a good example of this because although in the beginning Hitler possessed elements of shaki he wanted to create a revolution in the world and he wanted to do it in a material way and he was very anti- abrahamic he rejected ultimately he rejected Shakti by appealing to the conservative sensibilities within Germany or the patriarchal sensibilities and he feared the stability of his position and this fear this paranoia led to his downfall he became a decadent patriarch and therefore he was not a successful ruler within the Aryan tradition he made the mistake of Uranus now what exact role did Gia play in overthrowing Uranus because as I said he failed he was overthrown Gia seeks revenge with the help of her son cronis cronis represents the ancient black son not the present black son but the black son of the old Earth he is the usurper the black son is the usurper if Uranus represents the solar patriarch cronis is the eclipse that takes the Divine aspect of femininity as represented in the moon in the lunar aspect and utilizes it in an attacking sense an adversarial sense in order to destroy the old solar Empire and lead to the rise of a new son that is the meaning of the black sun and here we see it in the Greek tradition with Gaia seeking help from cronis so Gia constructs an adamantine sickle adamantine is is like diamond or it's a very hard material within Greek mythology and she gives this sickle to cronis with the plan of castrating Uranus so the sickle is interesting because of course the sickle represents the Harvest it represents death and rebirth and within modernity it's interesting to note that in those instances when solar patriarchy begins to become decadent there is a shudra Uprising or an uprising of the working class in its degenerated form we see this in communism which utilizes very often the sickle as one of its symbols because it is a harvesting it is a cutting away of the old and revolution of the new in a sort of chaos and it's very earthy it's an earth Uprising so here we have cronis acting as the usurper working with the divine feminine embracing the divine feminine in order to achieve his Revolution and rise to power when Uranus has sex with Gaia cronis lies in weight and he castrates Uranus with the sickle and from the blood of Uranus we have many new beings that are born when his genitalia is thrown into the ocean the blood and semen forms a foam and Aphrodite is born from this seafoam she is the first deity of the new Pantheon so after castrating Uranus cronis Rises to power he becomes the new patriarch and now we have a new Pantheon of gods in the form of cronis and the Giants but cronis falls into decadence as well because Uranus and Gia warn him that his children will rise against him someday and he will too lose power and so here we have an example of a cycle forming the rise and fall of Empire we have the revolution which offers promise in the beginning and then over time that Revolution sours and things begin to turn when those in power lose the organic foundation they lose their connection to the Earth they lose their connection to the divine feminine and they rule through brute force and tyranny as opposed to the organic connection with the people the organic connection with the casts so cronis ruling the Titans who are the New Gods he takes his sister rehea to be his consort and rehea gives birth to the next Pantheon she gives birth to Zeus Hades Poseidon and many others and with this birth of a new Pantheon the paranoia of cronis grows more and more and he begins to feel like he's resting on a very shaky foundation and so he begins to swallow up his children this is also seen in the Roman tradition with the myth of Saturn consuming his children cronis is the Greek equivalent of Saturn so cronis becomes a desperate and rehea is suppressed but rehea knows that she can maintain her power she can rise to power again if she forms a working relationship with a young upstart a new black son and the new black son is Zeus Zeus wants to rise to power he does not want to live under the tyranny of cronis and so he agrees to work with rehea in order to overthrow his father and so they devise a plan cronis asks rehea to breastfeed Zeus one last time before he is consumed and so she picks up a rock pretending that the rock is Zeus she sprays her milk from her breast across the Rock and her milk creates the Milky Way galaxy so this is a very important point because because here we see the rise of a new Earth a new creation and one of the occulted aspects of this myth the myth of Gaia is that GA is not our present Earth it is wrong to call this Earth Gaia and the Roman equivalent of Gaia is Tera it is wrong to call this Earth Tera because that was the earth of a previous cycle a previous age the Earth that we live upon now is the product of the rebellion of Zeus against cronis or Jupiter against Saturn and it is the productive Force the Earth of rehea the divine feminine that gives us the Milky Way galaxy gives us the universe gives us our present Earth so if anything the Earth that we live upon now should be called rehea so once Zeus Rises to power a great War erupts called the titano Maki and the titanim Maki is a really interesting aspect of Greek meth ology because there was an epic poem written about the titanim Maki that has been lost unfortunately but we know that in the titanim Maki Zeus LED his siblings against the Titans and they were successful and with the suppression of the Titans we have certain punishments such as Atlas being forced to hold the sky and we have Zeus ruling now as the new patriarch the new Sky father now he rose to power because of his willingness to work with the divine feminine but of course Zeus falls into decadence now within the Greek tradition we do not see explicitly the usurpation of Zeus however we do see in the Roman tradition The Cult of Liber form Libra in opposition to Jupiter so the Greek equivalent would be dionis in opposition to Zeus dionis or Libra or bakas is the present black son he is the black son of the current Pantheon Our Generation and so if we want to rise to power against tyranny we must Embrace The Cult of dionis against the tyrannical Zeus and continue in the revitalization the Rejuvenation of Aryan Empire in the Great cycle of time that continues for [Music] eternity a
