okay so tonight we're going to be talking about Aryan sexuality and there is a lot to talk about with sexuality in the Aryan tradition so this one is g to be long and deep anyway let's talk about Europe we're going to start with the European tradition as it relates to Aryan sexuality because most people who think about sexuality in terms of aryanism the first thing that comes to mind is National Socialist Germany and fascism in general because in our contemporary age most people associate aryanism with national socialism and you know I've spoken at length in the past about the traditional definition of aryanism um but it is important to recognize that when most people go into this question of sexuality as it relates to the arens they're thinking specifically of the policies directed towards sex in National Socialist Germany so we are going to discuss that but um first we're going to talk about Europe because understanding the history of sexuality within Europe allows us to conceptualize properly the esoteric nature as well as the exoteric nature of not only the attitudes towards sex in National Socialist Germany but also the Contemporary attitude towards sex in the west um real quick refresher on aryanism you all know this but just for the sake of anyone who's going to be listening to this lecture in the future when I'm speaking about aryanism I'm talking about the traditional definition of the Aryan which is a an individual or a culture that has access to the Aryan gods or the Aryan spirit this is a specific manifestation of spirit that is accessible to any living being that possesses awareness um and it is not limited to any specific political movement or uh any one civilization now the word Aran of course is refers to the uh Aryan cast within the um ancient vadic culture but as it's applied traditionally it simply means access to the Aryan Spirit okay now that that's out of the way let's talk about Europe to understand sexuality in Europe traditionally speaking you have to understand that Europe is incredibly gay I mean like extremely gay traditional European sexuality is obsessed with the idea of male penetration that is the foundation of sexuality within European aryanism now when I say that traditionally Europeans are obsessed with penetration what I mean is that the traditional view of sex within European Aryan culture is not really interested with gender the primary point of interest is in who is giving and who is receiving so the penetrative aspect is very important because essentially in most European cultures traditionally speaking sex is not recognized without penetration and this emphasizes the obsession with male sexuality within the Aryan tradition so specifically in Europe we're going to talk about the Asian tradition as well we're going to talk about India specifically uh but within Europe the idea is that sex is defined by power dynamics between the penetrator and the one who is accepting the penetration and with this dynamic in place there is this idea that one can esoterically take the form of a masculine position or a feminine position depending upon whether whether they are active in the penetration or passive in accepting the penetration and so with this dynamic in place there is a framework for understanding how one may become esoterically masculine or esoterically feminine depending upon how they use sex in order to explore their Consciousness so for one to be regarded as esoterically masculine within the ancient European tradition one must pursue penetration or the active expression of sex as their primary mode and if one is to develop as esoterically feminine one must become passive and receive the penetration now gender does not play a role in any of this because in ancient European culture there was no concept of gender the way we know it now I mean you had a recognition of males and females but there was no real gender identity that is a modern construct and um you could there was no political concern for the most part there are exceptions but for the most part there was no social or political concern with homosexuality so um you could be a man and you could be pursuing esoteric masculinity by becoming the uh the penetrative aspect or you could be pursuing esoteric femininity by pursuing the passive aspect now this gets really complicated because we're talking about divine feminine and divine masculine so obviously if you understand what divine femininity represents it's the active aspect so why then would someone on the masculine path act in an active Manner and the reason is because there is a transformative initiatory process that one undergoes through sex in ancient Europe and this is based upon accessing the opposing energy of one's uh of one's sex so if you are a man for example and you possess um a natural Divine masculinity you want to integrate the active aspect and so you do this through sex the penetration is the active aspect that allows you to connect with Shakti now this is a masculine path in that it is a path for those who begin in a masculine State and and are trying to integrate the feminine state but then you have those who begin in a feminine State and they're trying to access the Divine masculine so that is the feminine path it's the path that is walked by those who naturally possess Divine femininity and they must integrate passivity and so this is achieved by becoming the passive re receiv excuse me recipient of the penetrative aspect of sex and in this way you can begin to understand some of the strange dynamics of sex within the Aryan tradition because women possessing Shakti they already have an active spirit and if sex is supposed to be an exploration of consciousness or an exploration of the other there's this esoteric element of it where the woman is trying to now act in a passive role during the active sex this is how she connects with the essence of Shiva and the man is trying to act in an active role the the penetrative role which is him accessing Shakti within himself this is one form of tantric sex and we're going to explore other forms of tantric sex in this lecture but this is the primary form of esoteric sex within ancient Europe and this creates great confusion which we'll get into in a bit because you know if a woman is supposed to be active but she's obviously passive in Sex and and a man's supposed to be passive but he's obviously active so things get crossed and there's confusion whenever you remove sex from its esoteric Foundation from an understanding of the ulted element of sex but as I said uh earlier Europe is ancient Europe is obsessed with male sexuality specifically and there is a lot of homosexuality within ancient Europe with the exception of the Germanic tradition and parts of the Scandinavian tradition which are pretty violently heterosexual so let's talk about first ancient Greece so the Greeks were really interested in male sexuality and they expressed male sexuality with a lot of variety so you had uh open expressions of heterosexual sex homosexual sex um you had bisexuality you had group sex all of these things were openly practiced and talked about discussed within ancient Greece and uh you some of the great uh thinkers of um of Greece such as Plato they talked extensively about sex and the power dynamics of sex and some of them changed their minds about sex over time but if you want to talk about sexuality prior to the rise of modern philosophy with Socrates uh sex was not politicized at all in the ancient Greek culture it was just something that existed it had an esoteric role but there was no question of like well should we allow gays to marry or anything like that it was just basically a dharmic expression people were able to explore their sexuality pretty openly and um there was room for a wide variety of expressions of sexuality within the culture now that began to shift a little bit with the formation of modern philosophy because with modern philosophy you had a lot of questioning of the nature of sex and you had examinations of other cultures cultural attitudes towards sex so for example let's talk about Plato uh Plato had both good and bad things to say about homosexuality depending upon the time that he was writing early on he had much more positive things to say about homosexuality and then later he started to change his mind uh he changed his mind a lot about different things but with sexuality it's really evident um so Plato was examining Barbarian culture and and he was seeing how uh So-Cal Barbarian culture was not very accepting of sexuality out of uh the heterosexual Norm in that region and he started to question why why was it that for example the Germanic tradition was so firmly heterosexual and so in the Symposium he wrote this homosexuality is shameful ful to barbarians because of their despotic governments just as philosophy and Athletics are since it is apparently not in best interest of such rulers to have great ideas engendered in their subjects or powerful friendships or physical unions all of which love is particularly apt to produce so now we're starting to see with the birth of modern philosophy the question question of sexuality as it relates to politics and we have Plato actually making an argument for homosexuality as a foundation for a healthy culture because the idea is that it frees up expressions of Love expressions of passion and through these expressions of passion you access the active divine feminine element and you have have uh love expressed for Liberation Liberation as it relates to democracy so with from Plato's perspective the Barbarian cultures were tyranical and one of the means by which they preserved their tyrannical rule was through control of sexuality because if they could control open expression of sexuality if they could form aliz it and create laws to punish expressions of sexuality outside of the standard that is set by the state then they could actually have a firm grip on what is essentially the Shakti within their people and they can direct that Sexual Energy at will so for Plato he says this is a bad thing because if you want to have a culture that is dharmic he doesn't use the word dharmic but essentially what he's talking about is Dharma or a naturally expressive culture that is able to access all the various forms of differentiated Beauty in Liberation if you want that you cannot Place such strong restrictions on the sexuality of the public now in ancient Greece there was as I said hardly any restrictions on sexuality so like age was not really an issue um if someone was able to perform sexually if uh you know as long as they weren't prepubescent then they were considered to be um ready to engage in sex and that was just the norm within uh ancient Greek culture um as I said also various expressions of sexuality a wide variety were the norm within ancient Greek culture and this carried on to ancient Roman culture ancient Roman culture is basically just an extension of the expressions of sexuality that you find in ancient Greece now there were tinges of uh social maneuvering with in ancient Rome based upon sexuality more so than ancient Greece so uh like for example you had open expressions of like what you could call polyamory or uh homosexuality and bisexuality things like that but you know they were at sometimes mocked publicly like there was social mockery surrounding certain forms of sex or some people um accepted those forms of sexuality but there wasn't really a heavy politization of or excuse me there wasn't a heavy element of politics within the um control of sexual expression that came later with uh the Christian tradition you have some very important esoteric rituals involving sex within Greco Roman culture in ancient Greece you have the cult of dianis dianis was celebrated with the orgia the orgia is a festival with the goal of releasing inhibitions and so you had drug use consumption of alcohol music and sex of all different forms um and this was encouraged as part of the orgia because it is a liberating ritual and the idea is that if you can liberate yourself within the orgia you can gain access to the divine feminine spark which is the dionan element that I talked about in my lecture on n and the birth of tragedy it's that wild passionate aspect that is the fire the motivating fire of culture so sex played a very important role in preserving that fire and the Oria continued on into ancient Roman culture um specifically in the cult of Liber the bakus cult Balia the uh rituals surrounding bakas Incorporated sex is a very important element and there are other sex rituals within ancient Rome as well uh all of which which served very very important esoteric purposes initiatory purposes very similar to what I described with ancient Greece where you have this desire to access either the Divine masculine or the divine feminine depending upon where you begin and where you begin in that journey is not always dependent upon your biological sex uh it could be your nature you could be born with a very intense Divine masculine nature and then try to access or as a woman and try to access shaki through sex although that is something that was hard for the ancient Europeans to Fathom because as I said they were very very homosexual in a male oriented way and so uh the idea of lesbian sex was really strange for like the ancient Greeks for example and they couldn't even fathom it even though obviously happened but they couldn't fathom it um so anytime lesbian sex was described by the ancient Greeks it had to have some penetrative element they uh would even like go as far as to say that women who are having penetrative sex must have like really large clitorises or something like that or they have to be using dildos because they couldn't imagine sex outside of that container of the one who gives her ation the one who receives okay let's talk about the Germanic tradition as it relates to Aryan sexuality so European people are a sahas social body the general essence of Europa is solar in that it is oriented towards Transcendence um not Transcendence in a degenerated form but true overcoming of the material that is why Europeans are so obsessed with technological advancement and bringing about progress because it's the idea of pulling yourself up from the earth and expanding out moving towards New Dimensions of Consciousness and this is primarily done through technological development by Europeans they're trying to reach the sun they're chasing the sun um now there are variations in this expression but within the Germanic tradition ancient Germanic tradition and the ancient Scandinavian tradition there is this there is this dichotomy between the sahasra and the muladar these elements of Consciousness these states of Consciousness exist on a spectrum the sahasa has an adversarial state of the Madara and vice versa with the Germanic tradition there is a sort of adversarial excuse me adversarial relationship to the body and the body is seen as something to sort of be transcended um and so homosexuality or expressions of passion for the sake of sex alone is something that is very imminent it is very much related to Shakti and so um there have been struggles in the Germanic tradition swinging back and forth between very intense repression of expressions of the body so this is the sahasra element and very intense Embrace of the body this is the muladar element and you can see this very strongly in the history of Germany Germania in uh ancient times you would have swinging back and forth between pretty open expressions of homosexuality and then very intense repression of homosexuality when Plato was discussing the despotic element of the Barbarian tradition you know that's kind of like touching upon what could be seen in Germania you could see this very intense um repression of any expression of sex outside of the solar order everything was very orderly within those cultures now there is always this urge to access the adversarial state within the social body so for the Germans there is a shift back and forth between that solar element and that lunar element national socialism is interesting because it is sort of like a balance between the two because it is an anahata expression but there is still that Dynamic of the tension between the desire for intense order in sexual expression and the reality of the Madara element of German culture which is curiosity in open expressions of sexuality so it's very interesting to think about sexuality in Germany prior to the rise of the national socialists because you had very very open expressions of sexuality that would even shock contemporary people in the bimar Republic specifically in places like Berlin you know prostitution was common um all forms of polyamory homosexuality um everything you can think of in terms of sexual expression could be found within the vmar Republic and it was uh it was generally accepted but there was a breakdown of the culture um and even those who rejected modernity within Germany they still embraced this idea of Pagan sexuality that had more in common with the ancient Greeks than it did with the ancient Germans so you had the free body movement which is this idea of like Germans getting together stripping all their clothes and running in the woods together and this was like their expression of a free paganism um and then this free body movement and the esoteric elements of it actually led directly into the formation of national socialism national socialism is very Pagan um it leasts the the actual German expression of national socialism now of course there's many different forms of national socialism in our contemporary world but the original expression of national socialism in Germany is very Pagan and with this Pagan expression you had an exploration of contrasting elements so as I said prior to the rise of the National Socialist homosexuality was openly accepted and you can see in the early formations of the National Socialist Party there were prominent homosexuals like er RAM for example ER Ram leader of the sa um open homosexual and he was obviously given a lot of power and he was very effective he was a member of the Fright Corps prior prior to the formation of the sa and he fought Communists in the streets a lot of really intense uh battles in the streets with Communists and uh he helped to prevent a communist Uprising within Germany if it wasn't for Ernst Rah and uh his leadership uh there could have been a lot more success for Communists in that nation and who knows what would have happened maybe there wouldn't have been a rise of national socialism but anyway Ernst uh ROM's sexuality wasn't really a problem until the rise of the actual National Socialist Party to power and Hitler's integration of the conservative party within national socialism Hitler originally was very very critical of the conservatives um and he was a lot more radical prior to Rising ringg to power when he did rise to power he courted the conservatives because these were the industrialists that possessed the material means to allow for the German war machine to uh build itself up and and act as a launching pad for the Third Reich now the conservatives were very much opposed to the sort of liberal sexuality of the viar Republic and they had a problem with people like er ROM uh there was also other political issues at play that influenced the assassination of ernstrom but regardless his sexuality and the sexuality of other prominent gay National socialists was utilized through propaganda to just justify a major Crackdown on homosexuality that was an attempt to Plate the conservatives and so all of a sudden you had the criminalization of homosexuality now there are other really prominent National socialists such as Otto Ron Otto Ron was probably the greatest esoteric scholar or I wouldn't say scholar but he was basically an adventurer he was like indana Jones um and he uh collected esoteric information for the SS he was a very high ranking member of the SS and as a high ranking member of the SS he searched for the Holy Grail um he actually claimed to have found the holy grail and noted its location in a cave that was being protected um but he was not allowed to continue his research because his homosexuality and his criticism of some of the conservative elements of national socialism led to his supposed execution or assassination now there's a lot of mystery surrounding the death of adoran but most people accept that uh he was assassinated by the SS for um his unacceptable sexual activ and his critical approach to some of the aspects of the SS but what really needs to be focused on here is the fact that National Socialist Germany did not really live up to a full expression of Aryan sexuality because they failed to integrate the dharmic expression of the German people within the fr framework of the state um there was a selling out of shaki or free expression of sexuality to the conservative elements within Germany and so really that undermined the liberating aspect or the shocky aspect the fire that could have fed the movement of Germany into the future now you know it's Up For Debate as to whether or not that is really a relevant issue regarding the fate of Germany I personally think that it is relevant I think that there was sort of like a failure to integrate the Divine femininity uh with its fullest expression even though Hitler does possess a great deal of shocky and he's a very shocky force in that he acts to change the world it's an active Revolution so he is a shocky Force but it's only a half measure because there is that failure to allow for a full expression of the chaotic aspect of the divine feminine and so really you can't call sexuality within National Socialist National Socialist Germany Aryan because it does not meet the standard of a full expression of dharmic sexuality that we would see in ancient Europe now let's talk about dar aric sexuality as it pertains to the Indian tradition and then we're going to go back a little bit and talk about uh European tradition a bit more but ancient India so ancient India is a really incredible example to look at because sexual attitudes in Ancient India are very well recorded and they are extremely liberal so the ancient Aryans of the Indian tradition we're open to pretty much every expression of sexuality you can imagine and this is recorded in texts it's recorded in uh Temple art it's recorded in all different types of visual art and it is recorded within the tantric tradition itself within the tradition of shatana Dharma sexuality is very important and there is total openness to individuated expressions of sexuality because sexuality in the Indian tradition is considered an expression of Dharma and as an expression of Dharma there are as many expressions of sexuality as there are people so there's not an obsession with classifying sexuality in the way that we see in our contemporary world now there is this obsession with the idea that if you are homosexual you need to tell everyone that you're homosexual if you are um asexual you need to tell everyone that you're asexual and everyone has their own flag you know and they have their own acronym but this wasn't an issue within ancient India because being a dharmic expression it's just accepted that my sexuality is going to be different from their sexuality which is going to be different from their sexuality and it's not a problem unless we come into some type of conflict like for example you stole my wife or I stole your wife or something like that or I stole both your wives or whatever it's uh it's just it's a dhic expression now um it's woven into the fabric of Tantra Sex Magic is incredibly important in the Indian tradition it's important in the European tradition as well but it is very prominent in the Indian tradition and the role of sex in the culture in creating a uh fulfilling life was so important that you had for example the writing of texts like the Kamas Sutra the Kamasutra discusses the concept of Kama Kama is pleasure okay so the K Sutra is a guide for living a pleasurable life and most people uh in our contemporary World when they hear about the Kamas sura they immediately think of like it's a guide to sex positions and there there is a GU guide to sex positions within the Kamasutra but that is actually only a small element of the book the book goes into a lot of different things it goes into cooking specific Foods um the clothes that you wear making money uh interacting with people socially outside of sex and then it goes into sex and the idea of the commas Sutra is to prepare someone to live a pleasurable life what's very interesting about the Kamas Sutra is that it was utilized as an educational book for children in Ancient India because the Indians wanted children to understand what it means to live a pleasurable life before they enter into adulthood and try to form a relationship with someone because if they're well informed of their own nature of their own sexuality if they're well informed of the social dynamics surrounding sexuality then they won't just be pushed out into the cold world with no guidance which is basically what happens now in the west or or you have people learning all about sexuality from internet porn which you know has its own destructive aspect so yeah I I think that the Indian tradition at that time was very healthy in the way that it treated sexuality with such openness with a dharmic approach and by allowing children to to understand the role of sex um and how to approach it in a way that is healthy for them uh let's talk about mathuna as it relates to the tantric tradition so mathuna is Sex Magic I could talk about myuna for hours and I'm not going to extend the lecture that long so I'm just going to give a basic introduction since we are talking about Aryan sexuality it is important to discuss Muna so Muna is tantric sex and tantric sex takes multiple forms within the Indian tradition but at the center you have the concept of the Divine Union the Divine Union between Shiva and Shakti and so these are the energetic elements at play Within human sexuality and there are certain rituals um that can be performed in in order to explore those Dynamics like I said I will go into those rituals in detail in future writings and future lectures I already have written about some of them um but for uh for our discussion tonight it's just important to recognize that sexuality from an Aran perspective is something that takes many forms there's uh the physical expression there's the emotional expression there's the intellectual expression and there's the spiritual expression and all of these Expressions taken together that's what creates the tantric expression and the attempt to reach the Divine Union that is basically finding a dhic expression of your sexuality as it pertains to other people and forming a dharmic connection with them and that can look like a lot of different things you know like I said there are as many expressions of of dharmic sexuality as there are people okay I want to talk just about a few more things and then we'll get to the uh questions and comments the Renaissance so the Renaissance is something that is really interesting uh if we're talking about let's go back to the European Tradition now talking about Aryan sexuality in the European tradition the Renaissance is very uh very interesting because you have to see it in the context of of christianization so where has all where have all of these Hang-Ups about sexuality that we see in our contemporary world come from where did they come from they came from primarily the abrahamic Traditions with the introduction of abrahamism in Europe you had a very intense Crackdown on open expressions of sexuality there is a very specific degenerated solar order that is is put into place through the Christian Church through Islam through Judaism that uh defines sexuality in a very narrow way what is accepted and what is not and it introduces the concept of sin as it relates to sex there was no concept of sin as it relates to sex in the Aryan World there is no concept of sin in the Aryan world so how can you sin through sexuality you can't it doesn't exist in the Aran tradition but within the abrahamic tradition sin comes into play so now all of a sudden everyone in Europe is made to feel guilty about their natural urges and their natural interests and the spiritual expression of sex they're they can't connect with their gods through sex anymore because they're only allowed to connect with one God Yahweh and he's an uptight prick and he has a very very important thing for you to know and that is that you know sex is only for making babies and it only happens between a man and a woman and you know anything outside of that you need to be burned on a steak so that's the abrahamic approach and that poison spread throughout Europe and it influenced cultural ideas surrounding sex to this very day that is why we have so so many sexual Hang-Ups and just weird weird expression weird in a bad way expressions of sexuality where people hate themselves for their sexual expression that is and they hate themselves for their dharmic sexual expression now of course you can hate expressing yourself in an adic way but if you have a dharmic expression of sexuality you you should not be made to hate yourself but that is what is occurring through the abrahamic system now the Renaissance is interesting because with the ren sance you had a rebellion against abrahamism and you had an attempt to regain the Pagan spirit and so in those areas where the Renaissance was strongest you had a sudden rise of expressions of a variety of sexuality once again very similar to ancient Greece uh you had expressions of homosexuality bisexuality all different forms within the Renaissance and uh it was actively promoted as a way of reconnecting with the Pagan Spirit uh so this was like an attempt at regaining the Aryan culture now in India you had the spread of Islam and there has been no Renaissance in India because Islam is so vicious in its cultural poison within India that that the Indian people now have essentially taken on the abrahamic traditions and integrated them into sonat Dharma and so with that integration and even into tatra and with that integration you see a very strict standard regarding what is acceptable in sexuality and you see people who are Hindus you know advocating for for for example the execution of homosexuals and things of that nature and you have you know the expulsion of women from temples and you know just a personal example I went to uh sonad Dharma temple in St Louis Missouri and it was a beautiful Temple from the outside it was kind of wasn't it left something to uh it was kind of shitty on the inside but um there was this weird environment in there and then I found out it's because this this is a very specific Regional expression of sonat Dharma that is heavily heavily influenced by Islam and so until recently women were not allowed to enter the temple at all which is very it's not Aryan that is not an Aryan that is not an aspect of Aryan culture to just outright say that women should never be allowed in any Temple whatsoever which is what their perspective was um but there was no Renaissance within India and still to this day the yogic tradition within India the tantric tradition sonat sonad Dharma Hinduism is all poisoned by Islam and the sexual attitudes that are expressed within those Traditions primarily are poisoned by Islam to the point where a white man from Missouri is now expressing the Aryan tradition with much more clarity and connection to the original ancient tradition than pretty much any of the Indians within India and I often have to explain to them their own tradition because they're so divorced from it now uh can there be a new Renaissance yes of course and I think we're seeing it right now we are seeing a a massive swing towards the expression of sexuality in a very open way but is it Aryan no it's not Aryan yet because it is not based upon Dharma it's based upon this weird Matrix of designations of sexuality as I said earlier everyone is obsessed with their specific flag or having some cultural space made for them and it's heavily politicized if you politicize sexuality it's not dharmic you have to disconnect from politics you have to take sexuality out of politics or politics out of sexuality you got to get the government out of your [ __ ] bedroom before you can have a daric uh expression of sexuality and we're not there yet um but there is a desire for more Independence or Liberation in sexual expression we have things like pornography now pornography um can be good or bad depending upon how it's used it's all dependent upon the D the dharm of the individual for the most part most people are absolutely destroyed by pornography because they cannot it is a great poison and they can't transmute that poison into medicine but you know pornography has also been kind of a window for people to recognize that it's okay to cultivate a very specific independent expression of your sexuality and recognize that as something that is safe to explore so this is kind of like um being open to very individualized expressions of sexuality which in most cases is like a vuti expression of mental sexuality but for some could be a path to a purely dharmic expression regardless of their state of consciousness so pornography is not necessarily anti- Aran and it's not necessarily pro- Aran it is something that could be integrated into aryanism um but yeah those those individuals who say that pornography is like one of the greatest threats to the Aryan Spirit it does it's not necessarily so it's dependent upon how it's used just like any form of sexuality it's dependent upon how it is utilized within the culture how it is utilized within individuals as to whether or not it is dharmic or ad daric for Aryan people one last thing I want to talk about and that is sat Satanism as it pertains to sexuality so this is important because recently we've seen the rise of uh leftist satanic organizations like the satanic temple that make sexuality one of their primary concerns and ultimately Satanism is an adversarial expression of individuated nature within an Aryan framework that is oriented towards expulsion of the abrahamic tradition now we've seen how poisonous the abrahamic tradition has been to sexual attitudes for Aryan people so Satanism in its best form should be utilized as a way of rebelling against those restrictive ideas of sexuality but it's being politicized so organizations like the satanic temple they are explicitly political they don't understand the esoteric nature of Satanism anyway and they are not touching upon any type of real Aryan expression of sexuality so if you look to an organization like the satanic temple and you say well that must be the satanic approach to sexuality it's not it's not the satanic approach to sexuality is recognizing the individual Dharma the will to power of individuals and their sexual expression and seeing it for what it is it's an individual expression and it doesn't it doesn't it's divorced from politics it's beyond politics it's beyond good and evil and it is in opposition to the rigid social structure of the abrahamic system okay any questions or [Music] [Music] comments
