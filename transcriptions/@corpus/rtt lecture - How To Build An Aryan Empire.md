the Aryan people are in Dire Straits right now and have been for over 2,000 years because Aryan culture which was The Shining Light of Life on this planet has has been uprooted and degenerated by a cult that developed with the explicit intention of cutting the organic lines social spiritual economic political the organic lines of connection that held together all people within the beautiful tradition of aryanism there is a way to resurrect Aryan culture it requires the identification of the essential essence of aryanism and the active Pursuit Of The Gods by all people through an esoteric line that creates a family a grand family that unites the people under the beautiful influence of the Gods there is an ancient tantric text known as the naveda referred to as the fifth Veta and in this text there is a section that deals with Puja to the gods of the stage now the not of vaa is a text that describes the esoteric nature of art art being given to us by Brahma translated through Shiva further translated through the great sages through the tandava through the quanas and in the writing of the naveda so that all people may understand the essence of arianism and gain access to a meaningful life within our active age within the age of Shakti art is the ultimate expression of the esoteric of magic it is how we communicate the culmination of Aryan civilization to all people it is something that can be understood dharmically at every level of the cast system Aryan art is accessible to the sudra to the visha to the chhatria to the Brahman and there are Grand lessons to be learned Grand expressions of beauty to be found in Aryan art and these Expressions act as a bridge to the gods what is so Insidious what is so Sinister about yahwism and the degeneracy of modernity is that this art has been severed from us it has been taken from us and the culture that has developed around the degeneracy of the modern world actively suppresses the Aryan Spirit actively suppresses the presentation of Aryan art the thing that would connect us to our gods and give meaning to all people rather than Grant meaning to the people the current system the modern system places everyone within a machine where they act as slaves they're cogs in a machine and this is the result of the collapse of the cast system the true Aryan cast system now let me describe the true nature of the Aryan cast system not as it exists in its degenerated form in Modern India but as it existed in ancient times as it is presented within the naeda the naveda describes the cast system in terms of the stage everyone has a role to play in this Grand theatrical performance we have the sudra they are the Earth they are the soil they are the foundation of civilization in primitive times before the rise of the state before the rise of Empire we had simple tribes of sudra who struggled struggled vicious ly against the conditions of nature to reach for the Transcendent point to chase the Sun and access the gods they moved to the spirit we exist in an age the kuga where the body the material is the foundation and so the people in the foundation of the civilization they are the body they are the soil they they struggle against the land and they build themselves up they build themselves stronger through this struggle until they can create something greater and this is when you have the introduction of the visha the visha is the integration of the creative spark this is the fire of the civilization this begins to feed the engine of Industry the beginnings of Technology this is the basic formation of what we can begin to recognize as a civilization as an Aryan Empire again we are chasing the sun we are moving up towards the gods accessing the Transcendent Point as a people we beg in the soil we developed technology we developed money we developed the marketplace and this is the realm of the visha and of course when you have riches when you have Prosperity other people are going to try to take those things from you and so we now need individuals who are dutiful who are able to set aside momentary pleasure for the greater good those individuals who operate within the space of mind and are getting closer to that Transcendent Point those satic individuals and this is the rise of the chhatria or the warrior class we have the formation of armies true armies formal armies that exist to continue the struggle to preserve the soil to preserve the riches to keep everyone protected as we advance closer to the Sun and we be we begin to build structures we begin to build pyramids and temples pointing upward upward to the gods all working together as a body as one to advance to the gods and then in those fortunate times as nche called them fortunate times when the struggle of the warrior comes to a time of peace and you have a resting and you have created the conditions of comfort that allows for the rise of the brahmans which are the artists that is when you have the culmination of the Aryan culture as we saw in places like Athens you have that fortunate time in history when all of the foundations of the Empire have been formed in the soil in the fire of industry in the Transcendent mind of the military and then finally in the beautiful expression of art and culture creation the final formation of culture through the Brahman and the brahmans offer us that bridge to the gods that final bridge where we reach the sun we pass beyond the veil of Illusion as a collective as a people as a family an organic structure and we have a ruler a Shakra Aron who unites all of these casts into that singular body that basks in the glory of the spirit So within this system within the traditional Aran cast system you also have the Untouchables we're going to talk about them in a in a bit more detail in just a moment but the Untouchables are not what they are perceived to be in modernity you see because within the the Aryan tradition you have this organic family that forms but there are those who exist outside of this state outside of this Empire there are other peoples who are not part of that family and inevitably the Aryan civilization interacts with those people and those people are conquered now in modernity conquered people are enslaved they are colonized they are exploited or they are integrated they are not given a space to preserve their traditions and their Cults The Untouchables in modernity Within Indian Society are considered to be those who perform duties that are so disgusting and deplorable to the other cast that they won't touch them they won't touch those duties and they won't touch the people who perform them but this is not the original meaning of the Untouchable class The Untouchables were those people who had been pushed aside in the pursuit of empire in the pursuit of the the gods and rather than genocide these people rather than enslave them rather than mate with them and integrate them they were given their own land separate from the Aryan civilization where they could live freely and happily the way that they want to live according to their Dharma and you don't touch those people people because as soon as you touch those people you've poisoned your civilization either through exporting labor to [Music] them or importing them as laborers to take jobs away from the sudra class or to integrate them fully into your civilization so you're mating with the people and you're eliminating the biological Foundation of your civilization and destroying their civilization at the same time these are all ways in which Aryan civilizations have crumbled have lost their Foundation these people were considered to be Untouchable not because they were inferior but because it was recognized that the the Humane the Aryan way to treat these people who could not be effectively integrated into this framework of Aryan culture was to give them space to exist to be free to live according to their gods live according to their traditions and maybe someday they could observe the glory of this Aryan Empire and or organically create their own Pathway to the gods but this whole idea of forcing people into this order forcing people into this Empire forcing integration this is anti- Aran because aryanism is organic it has to be born from the soil from the earth it has to rise and it has to be a voluntary process and the people involved with the development of the civilization have to give their reverence through their own will to the cast above them as they Advance up up the pyramid up the hierarchy Chasing the Sun until they reach that Transcendent point this is why things like taxation taxation is anti- arean because if you have to force someone to give you their reverence to give you their resources you have no connection to the Aryan Gods you are not a Shakra Varon the Shakra Von is in direct connection to the gods and the Aryan gods do not force worship the Aryan gods are not like Yahweh they're not like Muhammad this isn't Islam this isn't Christianity this isn't Judaism the Aryan gods do not demand slavery they demand Mastery they demand Mastery over this realm Mastery over this plane of existence that is why they remain inaccessible to the slaves you cannot gain access to the Aryan Gods if you possess slave morality your civilization must be run by strong men and women who exist Beyond Good and Evil who access the gods through displays of heroic will and through these displays of heroic will they give energy to the people they feed the soil with the Waters of the spirit and this is what gives life gives sustaining blood and energy to the working class to to the sudra to the merchants in the visha gives inspiration willingness to die to give blood amongst the Warriors but these things don't exist within any modern civilization because the relationship that people have to the state is based upon Force it's not based upon the organic development towards the gods it's not based upon integration of the spirit it's all based upon you give me your money at the point of the gun within the nacha there is the concept of the jar the jar is a ritual container and within this jar you put in The Prana that is utilized in Puja to the gods of the stage the jar is a container that is a metaphor for the state for the church for the banking system for the education system the people give reverence the shudra the visha the chhatria give reverence to the Brahman and the Brahman take that energy that is being given to them and they create art from that and then give that art back to the people it is a natural organic system that allows for the uplifting of all people the sharing of power it is the duty of the brahmans to care for the shudra it is the duty of the sudra to give reverence to the Brahman because the brahans even though they have the ability to act as Warriors they have the ability to act as merchants and as laborers they cannot be artists if they are assuming these roles you need laborers to make way for merchants to make way for warriors who then make way for the artist who then make way for the gods you need every single cast and you need the Untouchables to be the contrasting point for your civilization you need contrast so that you can understand what makes your civilization special over any other civilization the jar is the container for reverence and it is said within the naeda that it is the duty of the one who has control of the jar to break the jar of his own will because if he does not break the jar of his own will he will lose his power now what does this mean the jar is the state power is given to the state by the people they give their reverence to the leaders of the state and the jar is filled now when the jar is filled it is up to the ruler to willfully break that jar and allow for Liberation and the sharing of wealth with the people sharing of prosperity if he doesn't do this there will be consequences someone else will break the jar the people will break the jar the military will break the jar the merchants will break the jar and as soon as that jar is broken as soon as the brahmans fail to uphold their Duty to break that jar the line to the gods is severed immediately and it has to be rebuilt well we have seen throughout history the failure of the brahans the failure of the chhatria and now we're see we're seeing now the failure of the visha because the world is currently ruled by merchants and they are failing to break the jar and so soon the shuar will break the jar and we will get even further away from the gods when this happens unless unless someone Rises or a group of people Rises to teach through ART through expression the meaning of life the path to the gods again someone who gives hope to the sudra who gives hope to the visha and the Warriors and recreates the Aryan Brahman cast and finally rebuilds the bridge to a true Aryan Empire blessed by the Gods When Donald Trump ran for office he received a lot of reverence from the shudra because he convinced them that he was going to break the jar or drain the swamp he carried around a big hammer said look at this Hammer I'm going to break that jar but did he no he didn't break the jar it was a lie and there have been many many liars giving false hope to the people that the jar will be broken by a true Shak of arton a true leader who recognizes their duty to bring the gods to all people and express the nature of the Gods through ART so that we may all bask in the glory of true Aryan Empire May that person rise May that group of people rise that will truly gain reverence from the people and break the [Music] jar
