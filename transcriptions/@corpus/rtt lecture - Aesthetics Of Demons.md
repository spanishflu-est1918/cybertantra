tonight we're going to discuss the Aesthetics of entities or the perceived ugliness versus the beauty of uh demonic and Angelic beings so this is a really complex topic and we can go about this in a variet of ways but as a foundation for understanding the importance of the Aesthetics of the esoteric in general it's important that we consider the messages that are coded in the appearance of specific manifestations so for example uh some people have asked why I call the school ride the tiger yoga uh a lot of people believe that I Nam the school after Julius ev's book ride the Tiger but that is not the reason why the school is called ride the tiger yoga when observing iconography surrounding durja the manifestation of Shakti I saw that she rides a tiger and studying the tantas studying the uh energetic difference between Shakti and Shiva and also studying the iconography of Shiva I identified something that was really impactful to me and that was the fact that Dura rides the tiger as a living breathing being she works within the living system of the active present age whereas Shiva rides the tiger by killing the Beast and meditating on its skin so this school offers the holistic approach to yoga in that I teach both the right- hand path and leftand path the first and second initiations and there is the aspect of riding the tiger within both initiations you have the um Shiva right-and path initiation where you meditate upon the defeated active world and then you have the dur element the Shakti element of the left hand where you embrace the active world and all of the major Concepts surrounding Shiva and shaki as they relate to the active world can be seen in their appearance within the Aryan tradition the appearance of the Gods is very important because there is an occulted aspect to the way in which these beings present themselves to us and the way in which artists have rendered the appearance of these beings so when you see an icon of a specific deity you should pay attention to these hidden aspects these ulted aspects because like I said you can learn a lot just from the imagery that is present and this extends to other aspects of the occult as well uh such as emblems the appearance of temples uh yantas and other geometric patterns that can be found within various Traditions I think it's also important as aide to note that within the yahwist tradition which is the great degeneration of the Aryan tradition you have Yahweh obscuring his appearance because he's not communicating to the people he's not communicating to human beings within this dimension of Consciousness with the same intention as deities in the Aryan tradition and so you can take that as a sign that the tradition is severed from any sort of occulted aspect that offers a path towards ultimate self-realization or elevation of the self Beyond dissolution yahweh's control of His Image Muhammad's control of his image various prophets within the Yahweh tradition are obsessed with the idea of not allowing their image to be seen because it offers them an added layer of power of control within that system you could say that the Aryan tradition is more accessible in a differentiated sense because the deities that appear here within the Aryan tradition do offer an outward communicative element that is a product of their individuated beauty and so when we talk about the Aesthetics of demons versus Angels We Have to recognize that the traditional demons within the wider framework of the yah's tradition they are representing themselves in an adversarial state to the extreme solar order which is pursued by the Angelic and this influences the way that they appear to us the way that they manifest EST in terms of their image so let's consider why so many demons appear in forms that some would consider or many people would consider to be repulsive or shocking first you have to understand that the Demonic represents differentiated form it represents the Embrace of the chaotic divine feminine it represents the Embrace of the liberating aspect and so if one is to embrace Liberation and differentiation the the manifestation of that being is directly aligned to their Dharma their individual nature and we know that the appearance of these deities is highly reflective of what they represent within the cosmic Symphony so let's take for example beab be abub appears as a massive fly with skull and crossbones tattooed to its wings to his wings this is a very shocking appearance and to understand the nature of beel abub you have to recognize that first he represents a great poison because he is one of the seven princes of hell and as one of the seven princes of hell he only becomes accessible in a daric sense to those magicians who are able to walk the left-hand path if you approach pabab or any of the seven princes without the proper container either working through the left-and path independently or through to a teacher the poison is too great and you will be destroyed or you will be harmed greatly through your interaction babab is associated with the manipura he's a great poison for the manipura Yogen because he represents gluttony and those who are rooted in the monipa can be destroyed by gluttony because there is this intense will towards activity and experience and it is the experiential nature of the manipura that can lead the manipura yogan to pursue activities for the sake of the experience alone and this can become gluttonous and can lead to self-destruction flies are very gluttonous creatures they will consume trash refu and for someone in the manipura who is overtaken by this gluttony it is a great danger for them to lose their ref mind aspect in selecting what things they should and should not consume now the gluttonous aspect is also a source of power if it is integrated effectively so for someone working with babam you could develop a sense of actively embracing whatever experience is brought to you with the confidence that you you are able to burn up the poison in the belly within the inner fire this requires a great heating of the body in an esoteric sense an increase of fire to be able to withstand that type of uninhibited Embrace of action and so be elub is also associated with fever fever in a very real sense because I can tell you from personal experience when you work with be elub he can make you ill he can actually cause you to have a fever I actually felt this earlier today and it's really incredible when you start to recognize that this aspect of this demon that would seem very repulsive to most that would seem to be a great threat um a great poison pure poison disease illness fever this can actually be a great source of power because if you become feverish in your pursuit of those things that are dharmic those things that bring you power then you can capitalize on all opportunities for the expansion of power but of course most people will not approach be elub because to approach be elub would mean that you have to overcome the initial repulsion to this gigantic fly representing disease for most people when you see this image and you consider the aspects of this being you would automatically assume that this thing is inherently malicious beel Zab wants to destroy you and you would not see the aspect of elevation or power that you can find within a working relationship with be elub and this brings me to the second major reason why demons often have a shocking or scary appearance and that is the inherent occulted nature of the left hand I have received criticism from some for openly speaking about the left-and path and being very transparent in my practices but you can speak openly about the left hand and you don't have to risk exposing the common person to something that they're not ready for because inherently most people the uninitiated are going to avoid those things that are demonic within the Aryan tradition nearly every great work of magic nearly every great text shows a bias towards the first initiation this is a bias towards the right- hand path for example in the naeda in the first chapter we see a bias towards the dvas over the Asura the first production that is given within the naeda in reverence to the Deva is something that is very offensive to the assura so the assumption is art forms have been created by rahma in order to elevate the Angelic or the or the dvas but it's also stated within the text and this is a culted because most people do not have the key to understand this but it's stated within the text that no the production is also for the asur it is beyond good and evil and so future Productions Future Works of part can Elevate the assura can Elevate the Demonic but of course most people are going to overlook this because most people the uninitiated they cannot understand nonduality they don't understand how to exist Beyond Good and Evil the Dharma that is expressed in the naeda or within the vashiva tradition is a Dharma that is reflective of solar order it's not the same form of Dharma that I speak about when I'm talking about Dharma I'm talking about fully realized dharmic expression of of the left hand dharmic expression within the solar order is directed towards unification it's directed towards order it's directed towards preservation of Concepts such as good and evil which are necessary concepts for the uninitiated to exist effectively within the active world to liberate oneself from this order is to undergo very antisocial acts the leftand path is inherently antisocial when compared to the general social order of the uninitiated because it represents a breaking away from the system of dharmic order which is oriented towards what is solar or what is Angelic and so if you're going to become a self-realized individual if you're going to escape the cycle of time in a differentiated sense you must first Escape this solar order you must first cut the legs of the Dharma Bull and when you do this you become adversarial you become adversarial to society to the system you exist now on the fringes because you are breaking away from slave morality you are embracing Master morality and those individuals who Embrace Master morality are a threat to the solar order now why would the Angelic presence reveal itself in forms that most people would consider to be beautiful well first we're talking about the Yahweh tradition the representation of the Angelic that we find in artistic depictions of heaven or the great Angels these do not really align with the textual elements of let's say the Old Testament however there is an ulted aspect which is being channeled through these modern depictions of the Angelic that is in fact in alignment with their energetic nature the Angelic exists for one purpose one unified purpose and that is to bring people into alignment with order with ultimate order unification now in the Arian tradition this Angelic impulse leads to Nirvana it leads to unification with God Consciousness in the Yahweh tradition there is this gap between true unification and this new point of unification which surrounds the cult of Yahweh So within that tradition the angels exist as agents for Yahweh and they are trying to direct humans to give themselves to Yahweh so they lack a differentiated nature because they serve only one purpose that is to build the Legion of Yahweh and this is why there is great uniformity in the appearance of Angels the Angelic within the yahs tradition to take a differentiated form a shocking form a pure pure representation of the nature of the self is an adversarial action and angels are not adversarial beings they exist to uphold the order which is established by Yahweh so they appear in very simple ways and they take very simple actions that are all directed towards a very simple end it's very insect like it's almost like a hive mind and there is no room for the type of individual Troublesome expression that we would find within hell because hell is a realm of differentiation to the extreme the most extreme aspects of pleasure and the most extreme aspects of self suffering existing simultaneously within one area compared to Heaven which is a realm of flattening everything is reduced to a singular expression which is the hive mind directed towards reverence for God now one last thing I wanted to mention in relation to this topic before we get to to the Q&A is the fact that demons do not always appear as a shocking or terrible form sometimes they appear as very beautiful creatures and they do this often times to entice because demons are after all aspects of poison of the left hand and so there is both a malicious and a benevolent aspect to them they are neither good nor evil and so this beauty like take for example Lilith when she manifests as a beautiful woman she can do this to in snare and enslave or or she can do this to inspire her beauty can be a source of great compulsion and reduction of individual will and power or it can be a source of great Liberation and advancement towards a realization of what is sexually natural or dhic to an individual so demons can sometimes appear as very beautiful beings and of course what is considered beautiful versus ugly ultimately is dharmic what I consider to be beautiful or ugly is going to be different from what everyone else considers to be beautiful and ugly now we can have some shared experience but ultimately my perception is informed by my nature and your perception is informed by your nature and so it really is true that beauty is in the eye of the [Music] beholder
