okay so tonight we are going to discuss patriarchal storm gods in the Aryan Tradition now just as a brief introduction to this um concept of Aryan tradition I want to clarify what I mean by Aryan when I say Aryan I mean Aryan spirit in the traditional sense so for example within the ancient Indian tradition those who were able to access the full expression of the pantheon of the viic gods were considered to be Aryans and the Aryan spirit is something that is accessible to all things that possess Consciousness so um I'm not talking about explicitly One race of people in terms of an ethnicity or anything like that I'm talking about aryanism from a spiritual standpoint so the Aryan Traditions share certain characteristics and one major point of overlap between those Traditions is the Aryan Pantheon so you can identify Aryan tradition based upon the formulation of the Gods within that tradition some examples of great Aryan Traditions are the Germanic tradition with the Norse gods such as Odin Thor frig you have the uh Greek tradition with Zeus and Hera you have the Roman tradition with Jupiter Mercury and you have the Canaanite tradition which became the Jewish tradition which includes the storm God Yahweh now the reason I wanted to discuss storm Gods patriarchal storm gods in particular tonight is because we live in a world that is heavily influenced by the social body which is rooted in yahwism yahwism is a form of monotheism that developed as part of the Jewish tradition originally the Jewish tradition which is now entirely monotheistic was a polistic tradition and so Yahweh was one God in a Pantheon of many gods and he assumed the role of the sky father or the storm God the patriarchal storm God within the Jewish tradition the polytheistic tradition so when I say that Yahweh is like Odin or like Jupiter or Zeus or Indra in the Indian tradition what I mean is that Yahweh assumes the role of the patriarch and he is the sky father and these Traditions are perennial and what I mean by that is that they share essential energetic truths or essential energetic um expressions and you can draw similarities between for example Odin and Jupiter and though they possess the same energetic Foundation they play the same role within their respective pantheons they are nevertheless individual beings they possess their own personality so when I say Odin is Young Yahweh I'm not saying that literally Odin is the same exact being as Yahweh what I'm saying is they have the same essential character now you would argue then that Yahweh does not have the same character as Odin because Yahweh is worshiped in a monotheistic Tradition now and the remaining Pantheon was destroyed and it is true that Odin still belongs to a Pantheon however the only reason why Odin has not assumed the role of the monotheistic skyfa is because the Germanic tradition has not degenerated to the same level as the Jewish tradition and in order to understand why why that is we have to look at the nature of the individual cultures how they're expressed how the patriarchal storm God plays a specific role in formulating a social body and what activities are occurring in the Contemporary age in order to lead to a transformation of these Gods because one thing you have to remember is that these gods are living beings and they are subject to change they are not confined to the myths that we have written down on paper they have evolving characteristics and this is something that can be demonstrated when you go back and you look at the development of various Aryan Traditions so let's go back first and look at the development of Yahweh as I said Yahweh was once part of a polytheistic tradition and he was a patriarch within the pantheon the you could draw a very close connection between Yahweh and Jupiter of the Roman Tradition now there was a primordial father being within the Jewish tradition known as L spelled e- l l and l is an equivalency of Saturn Saturn is the primordial Oneness so these figures these primordial fathers and there's many of them within the Aryan Traditions just to name a few we have yir in the Germanic tradition we have cronis in the Greek tradition uh we have uh Brahma in the um Indian tradition and these are primordial beings so they represent monism the monistic point um and in the Jewish tradition we have L and Yahweh is the son of L so there is a series of Patriarchs Yahweh was transformed from the patriarchal skyfa to the one God and how this occurred was through a transformation of the cult of Yahweh while the Jews were enslaved in Babylon when the Jews were enslaved Yahweh The Cult of Yahweh was presented to the Jewish people as a path towards Liberation Liberation From Slavery the idea was that if the Jewish people could give all of their energy to Yahweh and Elevate yahwe to the position of the one and true God then they would be liberated they would be made the chosen ones and a prophecy would form that would Grant the Jews the position of Master of this realm and that is the promise of Yahweh so yahwism was formed and yahwism is really synonymous with abrahamism so the abrahamic religions are all yahwist religions in that they all go back to the worship of Yahweh essentially okay now with the elevation of Yahweh to the leading position within the Jewish tradition where he is the one and true God and the polytheistic Faith now becomes a monotheistic Faith you have a very interesting occurrence Yahweh takes on the name of L so now when you hear l in the Jewish tradition but also in Western magic often times you'll hear the name L and most of the time when this name is invoked it is bringing in the power of Yahweh it is not referring to the old primordial God l l was usurped the idea now is that Yahweh is associated with the primordial Oneness and so you can see in the biblical tradition when Yahweh presents himself as the ultimate being the one and true God he takes on the name of the primordial Force now there is a major energetic difference between L the original L and Yahweh when he assumes the title of L because L does not have the type of active personality that Yahweh possesses because ultimately even though the cult of Yahweh is very self-denying and solar in a degenerated sense Transcendent in a degenerated sense ultimately Yahweh is a very imminent figure because he is a conquering Spirit a conquering personality he was able to destroy the rest of his Pantheon and assume power and now the cult of Yahweh is the dominant cult in the world okay so we now know how Yahweh was able to break off from The Cult of the uh polytheistic Cult of the Jewish people and form a new cult a monotheistic cult so let's think about the cult of Odin okay Odin is a patriarchal Skyfire father he assumes the same position within the Germanic Aryan tradition as Yahweh assumed within the Jewish Aryan tradition Odin is a very interesting figure because in ancient times Odin was seen as much more of a trickster than the kind of benevolent father figure that he's seen as now now they really emphasize the title of all father when referring to Odin but Odin was once viewed with a lot of fear and Scorn by the Germanic people um just based upon his magical practices Odin now has reached a point of great transformation because the worship of Odin is very abrahamic in our contemporary culture some of you may have heard of Odin ism odinism is a strain of Germanic polytheism where Odin is really elevated to the central position now only the most extreme odinist would take a monotheistic approach to odinism and there are some odinists who take a monotheistic approach but generally speaking the emphasis is placed on Odin as being the morally Superior figure within the Germanic tradition and Loki is presented as a devilish figure he is a satanic figure the adversary within this contemporary Germanic tradition so what we are witnessing now is the beginning of the degeneration of the Germanic tradition in the same vein as what occurred with the Jewish tradition and it is being perpetrated for the same reasons because the people who are obsessed with Odin and elevating the Alla especially within the racist elements of Germanic paganism they believe that European pagans especially Germanic European pagans are in a state of slavery specifically they often refer to the Jews as being the Masters and they have been placed in conditions of slavery within their Nations and so there's a Liberation cult surrounding Odin there's this idea that if enough energy is given to the all father that he will rescue the Germanic pagans from the conditions of slavery that surround them this is the same type of a culted approach that was applied by the yahwist cult we're seeing it happen in real time but with the Germanic tradition and if it continues to develop on this path there will be a time because this is the nature of the patriarchal Sky father there will be a time where the rest of the Germanic Pantheon is thrown aside completely and Odin will be elevated to a monotheistic God within the Germanic tradition that is how these Gods operate and it has happened in other areas in the past it happened in ancient Egypt there was a patriarchal Sky God that was elevated by a pharaoh to the position of a monotheistic God when a new Pharaoh came into power they uh changed things around and they reestablished the pantheon so they stopped the process but it didn't it didn't stop with a Jewish tradition it succeeded with the Jewish tradition because enough momentum was placed on that patriarchal cult now very interesting the Indian tradition had something similar occur in the Indian tradition you have Indra Indra is the patriarchal skyfa of the vidic tradition and originally he was the chief god of the viic people Indra Within Indian myth was a bit of a usurper in the same vein as Yahweh now what happened in the Indian tradition is that there was a tantric Revolution the introduction of what is called formal Tantra which occurred in India elevated certain Gods to higher positions than Indra so Shiva Shakti Vishnu these were minor gods in the Indian tradition certainly not on the level of Indra at least and with the cultivation of this degenerated Divine masculine aspect within Indra there was a reaction the reaction was the tantric Revolution and the tantric Revolution led to uh a total restructuring of the Indian tradition so that you had the preservation of polytheism within India now it's shifting again because specifically Vishnu is taking that role of the degenerated uh patriarchal solar figure within the Indian tradition but nonetheless polytheism was preserved against that usurping force a very similar thing also happened towards the end of the Roman Empire Libra is the uh roman equivalent of dionis and dionis in Viagra yoga we refer to him as the black son of the fana Liber is the roman equivalent of this The Cult of Liber developed within Roman society as a response to the elevation of Jupiter to a very degenerate solar aspect so you had Jupiter as a usurper trying to reach a point of monotheistic worship which was occurring within ancient Rome and then the cult of Liber was a response to this and the cult of Liber likely would have been a success uh there likely would have been a equivalent tantric Revolution within Roman society however something occurred that stopped this and that was the rise of Christianity the rise of Christianity within Roman society led the common people because the Common People the the the plebs were worshiping dionis through Liber and the rise of Christianity led to a shift where the Common People abandoned The Cult of Liber and they went to Christ and so there was a revolution within Roman soci Society but it did not occur within the Roman Pantheon it occurred with an outside invading tradition the Jewish tradition was an invading Force within Roman society and the Christian tradition specifically was elevated to the dominant force in ancient Rome and then you had Christianity spread across Europe but that's that's an issue for a future lecture but regardless you see this similar Trend with these patriar now the idea of the usurper is Central to the sky father within the Aryan tradition let's go back to the Germanic tradition yir yir is the primordial giant he is L he is Saturn he's a monistic point in Germanic myth the material Cosmos is literally carved from the body of yir the Gods carve the Giant and they create the material Realms from his body Odin is the chief usurping figure he is the one who conquers yir within the Germanic tradition he is the one who guides the carving of his body so he is a usurper now Aryan tradition is cyclical so yier reigned Odin Reigns there is a usurper to Odin in the myths the northern myths and that usurper is Loki Loki is the black son of the monipa within the Viagra yoga tradition because he he is associated with the manipura and he represents that force of overcoming the degenerated solar aspect so when Odin reach reaches a point of decadence and that's what this is It's decadent rule when he becomes the decadent King he has to be overthrown for New Birth and this is Ragnarok the rise of Loki where Loki leads a revolution against Odin and it causes mass destruction but in this destruction we have a rebirth and new God's rise this is actually also seen within the Arthurian Tales you can consider Arthur to be a patriarchal skyfa in that tradition and he is usurped by mrid mrid black son of the anahata within the Viagra yoga tradition he is the one who finds Arthur in decadence and he conquers him he kills Arthur of course he dies himself and there's a Ragnarok event it's very similar to the northern myths very similar so in this revolution we have new birth new growth and this is what occurs throughout all the Aryan Traditions at some point there is some element of this endless cycle of a king that rises becomes the new Sky father Reigns benevolently or Reigns very well for a period of time becomes decadent Falls to some type of degeneration and then there is a usurper and that continues On and On Through the tradition now there is a way for the sky father to prevent the loss of his throne and that is to elevate himself to the point of monistic worship to the point of monotheism this is what Yahweh achieved Yahweh was able to prevent a usurper now what's funny though is even though Yahweh was able to reach that point of elevating himself to monotheistic worship a new usurper rose out of that perhaps the most powerful usurper in any tradition and that is Lucifer Lucifer Rises to face Yahweh as the new usurper Lucifer black son of the sahasra within the Viagra yoga tradition and so now we have a continuance of this Grand battle between the patriarchal Sky father and the black sheep that seeks to elevate himself against the degeneration that is created by a decadent [Music] [Music] ruler
