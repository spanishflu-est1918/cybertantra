to be a public satanist is putting a target on your back. because of its implications

satan = will to power

There's a lot of confusion on what satanic nature is

Through movies, propaganda, etc, it's been kept as dangerous

Anton Lavey - was very public but very coy in the way he presented it. If he was publicly affirming some things, he wouldn't have gained much traction

### What is it
Satan is not an individual. It's not a he, it's not a being. It's not a goat, not a man with horns. This is not atheistic.

**It is a condition**, when properly understood. This condition precedes abrahamism by thousands of years.

It's occulted origin is found in Sanskrit: Sat + Tan.
- Sat means God, Existence and Being
Refers to any being that is fully self-realised. One develops to the point where one becomes one with God or one transcends the cycle of time and becomes an independent being beyond time. That’s asar
- Tan means spreading, becoming, propagating

Simply put, Satan is the condition of becoming God

As such, any individual on a path to self realisation, whether they seek reunification with the God head or whether they seek individuated expression, that individual is of the condition of Satan, aka Satan

To Spread over God - the  process to achieve godhood

To spread one’s essence beyond God- to overcome the tyrannical aspect. By doing so, cover the sun. To be as the black sun

To continue (tan) being. 

Preparation to become as God: action must be taken
This is a condition achieved through work. It’s all within the magical tradition of Satanism

Satanism in its true expression, is the pursuit of self realisation
There’s a big difference between those who act as and those who truly pursue

Do not associate satan with devil horns and a pitchfork

It’s an incredibly diverse expression. The way an individual becomes Satan is Dharma. Dharmic action

At its core: Satanism is the affirmation of life, of the human condition and of the will to power

power is the expression of one's dharma

if you seek power, realisation, no matter what that looks like, you are ultimately a satanist

Tantra is an umbrella term for the work that leads to Yoga. It includes many different practices. But taken to its extreme, it leads to Yoga. And Yoga is the magical path leading to the condition of Satan

So when the christian preachers rail against yoga, saying that it is of the devil, and that christians should not engage in it, they're right. Yoga is a magical system explicitly directed towards self realisation, whether that self realisation is unification with God or continuation as an individuated being. Regardless, it is dharmic expression that is the aim of Yoga. when you practice yoga, you practice Satanism. The energetic nature of the practice is ultimately satanic.

All living things possess the will to power. All possess the will to the expression of their individuated nature and potential and therefore life itself is satanic.

The Shatkona or inverted pentagram (two triangles, representing the union of the divine feminine and masculine principles) is also used by jews, because at the highest levels, jewish magicians are fundamentally satanic.

Abrahamism that these magicians feed to the masses is a container to keep others from achieving the same level of power.

RECOGNISE your will to godhood. for eternity, beyond the cycle of time. Hail Satan.

Is the satanic image we have from hollywood movies / medieval stories just pure propaganda or is there something to it?

Did Anton Lavey have to play on the perception of satanism by Hollywood to gain traction?
