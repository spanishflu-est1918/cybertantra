okay so this evening I'm going to discuss the occult practices of the so-called Global Elite or individuals who are associated with global power structure in some way so there is quite a lot of discussion in not only internet communities but now just in popular culture of the presence of certain clandestine groups that are involved in Black Magic occult practices that they utilize in order to control social conditions or gain power gain influence and the question is how legitimate are these claims that there are these secretive groups which are pulling the strings and utilizing occult practices to become even more powerful than they already are this is actually a bit more complicated of a topic than most would make it out to be because you have some people who would say no yes I I am positive that you know there are satanic groups that are ruling the globe and they get together and practice uh child sacrifice and things like that and I know exactly what gods they're worshiping and I know exactly how they're they're doing it and then you have people who say it's all just a conspiracy theory and there are no you know secretive occult groups operating at that level um it's just basically paranoia and um I'll say both of those positions are wrong to put it plainly yes there are occult groups that are operating that involve uh Black Magic Ritual and count among their members Global Elites or individuals who are involved in the global power structure that is certainly true now the claims regarding the specifics of those practices that's where things get complicated because while while it is true that these groups do operate and they do utilize magical practices the content of those practices is occulted and much of it is obscured and there's not a lot of information that's available to the public to be able to confirm the nature of those ritual practices but in this talk I'm going to tell you what I know about these practic IES and I'm also going to discuss a related topic which is the dynamic between Elite Cults and popular Cults in a society and in fact I'm going to start with a discussion on Ancient Rome ancient Rome is a perfect example of a society that was directed by an elite cult which practiced black magic explicitly and a popular cult which at times was utilized in order to control the plebians and at other times it was utilized by the common people as a source of power so that they could assert their authority over the aristocracy so this Dynamic uh is really interesting in the case of Rome because we have a lot of historical information about the specifics of these Cults now of course the actual practices of the mystery Cults of Rome are heavily occulted and you have to understand the perennial nature of ritual magic in order to identify what they were doing because the public does not have access to uh written records of the specific magical rights that were utilized by these mystery Cults but let's just uh take a look at two specific Cults that were operating in Rome and then we'll build on on that Foundation to discuss how these Dynamics operate and how these Cults are utilized in order to keep certain people in power okay so in ancient Rome you had a cult of Imperial apotheosis so the idea was that if you lived up to a certain standard of Imperial Glory as the emperor of Rome you would be deified you could rise to the position of official recognition of your godhood and in order to do this as I said you had to meet certain standards so any Emperor who wanted to achieve godhood or any Emperor who wanted to connect their lineage to the gods had to follow those standards that were set and automatically this serves two major purposes one it deifies the emperor so the emperor becomes sort of like a living God or a prospective God and so there is a religious hierarchy established within the culture the other purpose that it serves is to essentially bind the emperor to certain expectations regarding the nature of their rule so if the emperor deviates from these standards he is displaying his lack of godly power and therefore he is not going to achieve deification he's he knows that he will not be recognized in the cult after his death and this is sort of like an internal control system it upholds a certain standard of regality and honor within the Roman Empire this is what Eva was referring to when he wrote about pagan imperialism and how he believed that it could be utilized as a foundation for creating a healthy uh aristocratic culture it's the combination of spirit in the form of deification of the emperor and the Divine Right To Rule with the material Foundation of of the Senate of the empire of everything being directed in a very formal way to solidify the continuation of cult within Roman society so that was the elite cult and the elite cult being oriented towards divine right to rule recognized uh a certain degree of moral ambiguity in the actions of the emperor because even though there were certain ethical standards that were connected to deification the idea is that the emperor is above all and and he has the right to make decisions that may be considered evil to some or good to to others but ultimately this doesn't matter because he's acting as a representation of God or the gods or the the Divine spark within the Roman Empire so that is itself a master morality it's the idea that you can act outside of any sort sort of rigid idea of Ethics the ethical Dogma that we see in modern culture resulting from the abrahamic cult and other forms of degenerated solar masculinity this was something that was not present amongst the Roman Empire or the Emperors themselves now the popular cult so the specific popular cult that I'm going to speak about is the cult of V now bakus the Roman equivalent of dionis also known as Liber bakas was a liberating Force for the people and so the Roman aristocracy realized partially uh due to their knowledge of Plato and Plato's concept of the Republic that the common people need to be given an Outlet of free expression so that they can feel uh like they are able to release tension because if you have a tense Cult of common people as your material Foundation as the body of your Empire your Empire is going to fall you're going to be overthrown at some point so you want to keep keep the people kind of Comfortably Numb or you want them to feel like they have all of the freedom that they need right so if you give them the festival uh if you give them the Oria if you give them wine and dance and song then it's less likely that they're going to revolt against you so that's one form of popular cult now what's interesting about this form of popular cult is that it's not really based on slave morality I mean it did keep people in a condition of what could be considered slavery because they never developed Beyond basic Hedonism to recognize any greater purpose but these are culture bearers for the most part so they may lack the the capacity to evolve beyond that condition they are natural sudra they are um low cast people and that doesn't mean that they are bad people that doesn't mean that they are any less valuable inherently it's just their nature to live a very simple life a life of Simple Pleasures but there's always the threat that the common people will begin to resent the aristocracy and so there are times when the food and wine and song and dance is not enough to keep the people under control you need something a bit more restrictive and that is when you introduce the slave cult the pure slave morality cult now there was a period in the history of ancient Rome when the cult of Jupiter was starting to lose its power and it was about to be replaced by The Cult of Liber or bakus and at this time there there was potential for a great popular Uprising and this would have led to the destruction of the aristocracy and the establishment of some sort of democracy within Rome well of course the aristocrats don't want that to happen so they had to introduce something Beyond The Cult of Liber and this is where Christianity comes comes in Christianity was incorporated into the Roman Empire as a system of control a system of slave morality the common people were transformed from followers of bakus to followers of Christ now it's funny when you think about the image of Christ there's a lot of similarities between bakus or dionis and Christ dionis is the dying and Rising God there is a resurrection myth surrounding dionis very similar to the resurrect excuse me Resurrection myth of Christ with this being a central element of Christ and the idea of Christ being a liberator and someone who fights against the system against the power structure it was very easy to shift the public towards Christianity but the big difference between Christianity and the cult of Liber is that Christianity has a very strict moral code and it is very passive it's a pacifist religion and so what occurred was all of this revolutionary momentum that was built up in the cult of Libra was dissipated and it was turned into inward instead of viewing the external world as something that incorporates the Divine spark and something that carries inherent value to be transformed by the actions of the people suddenly now you had a shift towards self- flatulation the material world was worth nothing to the Christians so it was easy to just abandon the kind of intense physical imminent Revolution that the cult of Liber had to offer everything was turned Inward and so the Holy Roman Empire utilized Christianity as a means of instituting global slave morality and Christianity the church spread across the globe carrying this disease of slave morality with it now as I said earlier most people are culture bearers and they cannot rise to the level of an aristocrat because they're just not naturally oriented towards that position but Christianity is sort of like this Insidious thing that kind of got out of hand when it was being utilized to keep people in this sort of like Catholic slave morality it was actually being done in a way that was even though it was not nearly as liberating or um or imminent or enjoyable as Life In The Cult of Liber uh you still had this idea that the common people should be given a good life or should be protected and so like the Catholic church had specific standards for uh labor labor protections that went out the door when the slave morality of Christianity radicalized and became a lot more violent and a lot more intense and way more fundamentalist with the Protestant Revolution so with the Protestant Revolution you have the fears of the elites uh coming to fruition uh but now instead of it being a cult of Liber where at least the Pagan spirit is preserved and you have the potential of a rise once again of a a healthy uh pagan aristocracy you no longer have that you just have endless death cult that is what abrahamism has become it has lost its aristocratic element and it has just become This Global death cult okay so This Global death cult now threatens the stability of any sort of aristocracy worldwide because the sudra spirit is built into Christianity it's built into Islam not so much into Judaism but we'll get to that uh but it is built into Christianity and Islam heavily and so there is this skepticism this deep skepticism of worldly power within the abrahamic tradition and so if you are someone who is wealthy or if you are someone who possesses social influence if you hold political office you've got to be really careful not to seem too arrogant or not to seem too powerful or influential because the Christians are going to start claiming that you're sacrificing babies to mik that's what's going to happen because the slave morality is so deeply instilled in the common people that they are just looking for victimization all the time always seeking that and they are resentful of those who possess the things they don't have they're resentful of money they're resentful of fine clothes uh they're resentful of of a healthy political structure everything has to be reduced to this low lowest common denominator so if you are a [Music] modern Aristocrat if you have money if you have social influence and you want to protect that it makes sense to form a network of individuals who share your interest in preserving those conditions for you and your loved ones because at any point in time and it's happened many times throughout history the common people can get pretty rabid and decide that it's not fair that those people have something and I don't even though the common people have been told that the material uh the material wealth that's held by these people that's not the wealth they should be seeking they should be seeking wealth we in the afterlife that's gone out the window because ultimately Christianity is nihilistic and so that nihilism is what really Reigns Supreme a nihilistic Hedonism is the rule of law amongst the common people and so this slave morality has led these people to have this sort of moral indignation the common people they believe that it is morally righteous for them to destroy the elites to destroy the aristocracy and take everything for themselves and share it in some type of global abrahamic nihilistic communism that is basically where we're at now so if you are someone who possesses wealth and you want to keep it it makes sense for you to form some type of social group or social order to keep that 12 and there are many such groups so let's go through some of the modern occult groups some of the big ones and talk about their belief system and why they do the things they do let's begin with the Illuminati so the Illuminati is a very interesting cult because it is very indicative of the vti age that we are presently living in it's an Enlightenment cult and and the idea behind the Illuminati is that it is a group of individuals who believe that the church has had too much influence over the culture and it has led to a condition where the common people and the structure of the church these elements are going to reject reason reject technology and hold back progress so once again it's very Aquarian it's like this perception of the future that we're we are aspiring to in this vudi age and we're going to in intellectualize everything well that's what it is on the surface but the occulted element of the Illuminati is that this is a demonic cult it is a satanic cult it is a cult of elitism and it is highly likely that there is some association between the Illuminati and the cult of methus um Gerta the author of faou which deals with mephistophilis and actually deals with the esoteric nature of mephistophilis uh in great detail with so much detail that Gerta had to have some understand understanding of the actual nature energetic nature of mephistophilis through some type of practice Gerta was a member of the Illuminati and being such a high profile individual and having this knowledge of mephistophilis as he did it leads me to believe that it's likely that there was some element of methos opis worship involved in the original Illuminati now I can't confirm that but it's just my opinion based upon the symbolism that is utilized the goals which obviously overthrowing Christianity and ushering in a new satanic age which is essentially what they were trying to do this is very much in line with the nature of of mephastophilis so the Illuminati is it still in operation I can't tell you that one way or the other because I don't know I have no uh idea if the Illuminati has continued um it's likely that it has because if you have an occult organization in place that has that kind of momentum and power behind it um and the symbolism is still present the energy is still present Within the Contemporary age uh then yeah it's highly likely it's still in operation there's been many occult groups similar to the Illuminati which have gone defunct which are never mentioned by the public the symbolism never appears there's not this sense of the energetic presence of that cult and whenever you sense that energetic presence and it's something that is represented on a wide scale as it is it's highly likely that it is still in operation so the Illuminati and we'll we'll get to this in just a moment in detail but the Illuminati is a master morality cult these are individuals who they outright reject religious dogma and so they are existing Beyond Good and Evil we can assume this based upon the intentions of the original Cult of the Illuminati and considering the nature of an Enlightenment cult that is opposed to the Church of course they're going to be opposed to dogmatic slave morality so that's one example uh Freemasonry okay this one is really complicated Freemasonry in its purest form and original form is very luciferian uh it is based upon the traditional initiation of the mountain you have an ascending path where there's this idea of perfecting the self through your working tools uh you are an esoteric Craftsman basically and you use you utilize these working tools in order to explore Consciousness and reach an elevated position this is the Ascension that occurs now there is a descending element to this as well you have your right hand path Ascension of up the degrees and then there is a descending element but we won't go into the specifics of the descending element but it's present there is this realization when you reach the highest levels of masonry that this is a cult of Lucifer this is a cult of Enlightenment this is a cult of um transcending moralistic Duality essentially and you come to that realization through the working tools now how does this relate to Global power structure well if you want to create a a community of individuals who have the capacity to help you defend your position and you want to be around other people who understand the nature of power you cannot be around people who possess slave morality you cannot be around unenlightened people you have to be around people who have reached Ascension and the only way you can confirm that the individuals you're surrounding yourself with have the capacity to operate from a point of Ascension is through some type of initiation if they can complete the initiation they have been vetted and you know that you can trust them at least to some degree so it makes sense why you would have a formal occult structure in order to uh recognize whether or not an individual should be allowed into your inner circle it's a really smart thing to do and it has worked for a very long time so this is masonry however masonry has changed quite a bit because it is splintered and there are so many lodges and lodges have different conditions they have different uh people within their hierarchy and for the most part part at least in the United States masonry has become sort of like a social club for Christians basically it's very abrahamic at this point now still you have the essential hierarchy of masonry which uh remains luciferian but most of The Lodges that you're going to visit um in the United States the even the heads of the lodge have no idea they have they have no clue as to the occult significance of masonry so you know your local Freemason is not poisoning the well he might be but you shouldn't assume that he's sacrificing babies and poisoning the well because he's probably just some Boomer good old boy who [ __ ] goes to church you know every Sunday uh along with attending Lodge so uh masonry yeah there are of course lucif Arian elements to it but once again it makes sense as to why someone would want to involve themselves in those kinds of practices let's talk about one more cult and that is the Bohemian Grove cult or the Bohemian Club okay so this one's really interesting uh a lot of you have probably heard about The Cremation of care ritual because Alex Jones infiltrated Bohemian Grove and filmed some of the ritual created a documentary where he claimed that uh The Cremation of care is basically a molok ritual or ritual to ball and um so I'm going to talk about that whether or not that's legitimate um in order to describe the the nature of The Cremation of care we've got to go back to the foundation of the Grove play so uh within Bohemian Grove you have all of these you know like socialites Elite people who are invited to attend this basically it's like a summer camp type thing uh and it attracts a lot of attention because of that because you're wondering why are these Elite people all getting together you know and we've already discussed why they would do that but uh within the Bohemian Grove you have the Grove play The Grove play is very old uh it has its roots in the late 19th century and there are many many forms of the Grove play but it has been formalized over the years and the foundation of the Grove play a heavy influence of the Grove play is the fa Opera which is very interesting because you can consider this to be once again a potential connection between mephistophilis and another one of these Global elite Black Magic Cults but once again I can't confirm that this is a mephistophilis called it's just interesting that the fa Opera played such an important role in the foundation of the cult so the Grove play The Grove play involves the character by the name of care okay care is the antagonist of the Grove play and within each Grove play except I think for one on record K is murdered he's ritualistically sacrificed and and burned within the belly of a giant owl statue so this is similar very very similar to mullik child sacrifice because with child sacrifice to Malik you have the oven you have the placement of the child on the Altar and the burn turning of the child to ashes and the child in this instance is not just limited to an actual human infant the child is symbolic yes there were human infant sacrifice to The Cult of Malik but at its essential Foundation ritual sacrifice to Malik is about severing ties with those things that hold you back from expressing your full nature so this would be associated with the character of care in the Grove Play Because care represents worry it's it's being used in in um in the sense of uh throwing away your cares because your cares are your source of worry anxiety fear and you're throwing those away you're burning them in the fire you're taking all that anxiety and fear and you're destroying it now anxiety fear these are all associated with the belly with the manipura with inner fire and so fire worship and an occult ritual sacrifice utilizing fire is something that has been practiced in alignment with cultivation of inner fire and the will to act and the will to create for thousands of years um and The Cremation of care is just another example of an occult ritual an esoteric ritual where you are sacrificing that weight that anxiety that fear that thing that's holding you back from taking necessary action there is a very clear element of Master morality within this cult because with the sacrifice of care with The Cremation of care you have the burning away of slave morality because what is the source of fear in this scenario in this ritual it is attachment it's attachment to the consequences of action and even thinking on something like the Bhagavad Gita when Krishna is instructing Arjuna on how he should approach this battle he is trying to bring him towards the realization of the necessity of eliminating care throwing care Into the Fire of course this is interesting because Krishna is representing the inner fire and Aruna is representing the vishi he's representing the air he's representing reflection self-reflection and so in order for him to overcome the fear within himself through the self-reflection Arjuna must access the inner fire which is being taught to him by Krishna we live in the shy age we live in the age of inner reflection of air and within that age it's very easy to become uh crippled by contemplation over contemplation to where you can't take action anymore and one of the barriers towards action that you must overcome is fear of Hell fear of being punished for sinning because if you can't overcome that you cannot achieve imminent power at the level of the global Elite you just won't be able to do it you've got to be able to act in a very ruthless way to defend your position the only way you can do that is to pursue power without the bonds of dualistic morality you have to burn burn it you have to burn the care and the fire now is the Bohemian Grove ritual sacrificed to Malik I don't think so I think it's similar to Malik sacrifice but Malik is not related to The Owl and the altar that is utilized in Bohemian Grove is a large owl the owl does not have the same energetic signature as the bull which represents mik it doesn't have the nature of mik at all the owl is associated with AA so it's not something that uh you would utilize in any sort of serious ritualistic pursuit to represent destroying fear um so there's some other element to the owl that I don't really understand I'm not sure why they utiliz the owl this is something that's heavily occulted and i' obviously well not obviously but I've never attended Bohemian Grove so I don't know there is similarities as I said to burning away fear and burning away care but the owl statue has to do with something else it doesn't have to do with mik and it doesn't have to do explicitly with the sacrifice that is occurring there's some other element there U that's something to explore in the the future but for now I will tell you that it's highly unlikely that that statue or that ritual is a mik sacrifice however I will tell you that there are people in this world who are involved in practices that would absolutely shock and disgust you and I know this for a fact I grew up around a lot of people who were involved in such things and these people are powerful people and so yes there are people not everyone who has a lot of money not everyone who's involved in the political system not every socialite is involved in really serious blood sacrifice and other black magic practices of a similar nature but there are some I can tell you that for certain and those people operate with a master morality now whether or not those practices are serving them whether or not those practices are serving their Dharma that's something that you have to examine on a case-by casee basis but the fact of the matter is there are two two types of people in this world there are people who are willing to do what it takes to realize their Dharma and are not willing to be held back by any sort of dualistic morality and there are those people who will always be slaves to that system of dogma and absolute submission that comes about through dualistic morality and you have to decide where you are going to align [Music] [Music] yourself
