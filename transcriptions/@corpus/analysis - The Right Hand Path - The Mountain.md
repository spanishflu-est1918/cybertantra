The Right Hand Path we teach is the revitalization of the original tradition within Tantra

This is the only school that utilizes Rooted Conciousness, a revolutionary idea and a powerful system.

This series will explore the ascension in the Right Hand path describing each state of consciousness, based upon the chakras and the methodology of Kundalini Yoga from each state of consciousness
	
## What is Kundalini?

Kundalini is an ancient Yogic method. A form of Magic, with the goal of achieving unification of the self, or the state of Yoga through advancement up the spine, the harnessing of Kundalini energy and taking it up the spine into each Chakra until reaching the Crown (the Sahasrara)

This process represents the movement of Shakti from the base of the body up to Shiva at the Crown

Kundalini can be accomplished without practice. You can accidentally bring Shakti to Shiva. You can do this through Yoga practice, through the use of drugs, totally sober, etc. So long as the Serpent (Shakti) is brought to the Crown (Shiva), you are practicing Kundalini

## What is the Right Hand Path
It is a process of refinement

It is not the state of being in a love-and-light new age, hug-the-world mentality. This is a major point of confusion, a major degeneration from the original tradition.

It is the process of unifying the self by exploring each state of consciousness and bringing Shakti into unification with Shiva

Once this unification is achieved, you reach transcendence

Transcendence is the ultimate goal of the Right-Hand path

It is NOT a lifestyle

If you continue in the Right-Hand path forever, it means that you have failed

The goal is to reach Transcendence. Once you reach transcendence, you achieve ego-death

However

In this school, we celebrate the Ego as something that is good. This is a Left-Hand path school

We recognize Immanence as possessing equal value with Transcendence

Most schools that teach the RHP believe that when you have destroyed the Ego you have achieved the ultimate goal, which is to exist as a part of Oneness, in a state of unification with the Godhead, or the Monistic Point, or whatever the fuck you wanna call it

It is true that if you want to achieve power, you must first destroy the Ego. You must recognize the poison that is inherent in power

## The Ego

The Ego is poisonous, make no mistake. Just as it can bring you power, it can also destroy you. Through embrace of the Ego, prior to the process of refinement, you may fall victim to self-immolation.
The Ego is poisonous because we are ALL born into a state of unrefined Shakti. Shakti, the divine feminine force, is the foundation of the present age. We exist within the Master Age of Shakti, in contrast with the Mster Age of Shiva.

From the perspective of The Yugic Cycle, there are 2 yugas within the Age of Shakti, the .... Yuga and the Kali Yuga. Within both we exist as EMBODIED beings

The physical manifestation of the body is the foundation of ALL experience within the Kali Yuga. It is the platform of consciousness.

### The Piramid of the Self
 - The body - the blood
 - Inner fire - passion, creativity, the cosmic womb
 - The mind - introspection, imagination, the foundation of contemplatioin
 - Spirit - the subtle body, that which unifies, which gives us access to shared experience
The manner we experience the self and everything that surrounds it is entirely dependent upon the structure of the Pyramid within a given age.

#### The Body - the blood

We exist in the Kali Yuga, so the Blood is the foundation. This has a major influence in the way in which we perceive reality.

Everything that is a gross perception is immediately perceptible

God is like a whisper in the wind. That which exists beyond the immediate dimension of consciousness.

It's easy to recognize a rock. As you climb up the pyramid of the self, all aspects become more difficult to recognize, but this wasn't always so. This is a characteristic of the present Age.

It's possible to reach a point where you can access and recognize with equal awareness every element of the Self, but that requires Yoga. That requires Kundalini and the Right-Hand Path.

#### Inner-fire
This includes the emotional element of the Self. emotions can be seen in others, can be felt. They impact the way your body operates. But it's not so cut-and-dry as flesh and blood. Things become slightly more subtle

#### The mind
You can't see it, you can't touch it, because it is of a subtle nature. The mind can operate in communication with emotion, in communication with flesh and blood, but it's very hard to capture and hold. It is associated with the contemplative chakras

#### The spirit
It's the most subtle point. It's the Sahasrara. This is where you have connection to those things that most people in our present age will probably reject or be skeptic towards. Even religious people who claim they believe in a higher power hold reservations regarding the nature of the Spirit.

This is because it is so experiential and very difficult to access. Since we operate from a physical foundation, it makes sense since people lack a direct experience of it.

You have to work very hard to access that point.

This is why you can accidentally experience Kundalini through drugs, but for most people this won't work, because they lack the fundamental understanding to conceptualize the experience, to understand its significance, so they're caught in a loop of constantly searching for that point

just
before
transcendence

The drugs will take them to the the brink, and then they require the necessary understanding to be able to take that final step into the Monistic point.

Most will fail, because they won't grasp what is occurring. They tell themselves that what happens every time they try, again and again, is an Ego death.

This is the only way that psychedelics can become addictive. Not physically but spiritually addictive.

In this school we do not recommend that most people attempt to achieve Yoga through drugs.

We recommend to pursue Yoga through a formal initiation in the Right-Hand Path.

There ARE people who can achieve Yoga without gurus. But we do not recommend it, because Yoga is EXTREMELY dangerous.

The Right-Hand Path is dangerous

We are dealing with drastically altered states of consciousness. Bringing you into states that directly alter you, undercut your foundation and undercut your foundation, forcing you to assess that which is weak within you

Uprooting that weakness, destroying it and then advancing up the spine, climbing the Mountain

This is what we do in this school. We climb the Mountain

## What does it look like
We begin by preparing the body for the journey ahead.
This requires entering into a state of consciouness where you are firm enough in your awareness where you are able to advance.
This varies greatly depending upon the individual.

Anybody who tells you this is a straight-forward path, that there is one method, is bull-shitting you.

This is because the journey is entirely dependent on Dharma, the individuated nature of the individual. Part of the process of Yoga is exploring what is your Dharma, and how you access it. How these different elements of the Self interact with one another in order to create a unique individual.

If you're working with a Guru who knows what they're doing, they will give you individuated instruction

There are milestones that everyone should meet, but there are many paths up the mountain. 

This is why it is so important to have a Guru. Your Guru should be able to identify what you need on an individual level, in order to advance through all of the potential maladjustments at each state of Consciousness, and there are many.

In our method, we start with entering the Kriya state

### Kriya
This is the passive observation state. We want to reach a state of meditation that we can maintain consistently throughout the day. Meditation is not what happens when you sit down and relax. It is a state of being.

One-pointedness is not a state to be in consistently, because it will drive you fucking insane. But most people are forced into this state by society. Because if you're a cog in the machine and you're placed in your spot, doing one task over and over again, being in a state of passive observation is not good for business. It's going to draw you away from your task, and you might start thinking about "oh, wait a minute. Why the fuck does that Coca Cola commercial make me horny? What are they doing to my brain? What the fuck is going on here? Why did my doctor give me this pill and tell me, you know, I need to cool it and take this pill every day so I can feel happy? Why do I have to have a pill to be happy? My ancestors didn't have to have a fucking pill to be happy"

If you can stay in this state, you are going to be easily controlled. You're in a reactive state. When they shove the advertising in your face that's supposed to entice you, you're going to react to it immediately, and you will be drawn into their world, and you will live by their standards.

This is what some people refer to as The Matrix

**When compelled, you will take action. When horny, you will masturbate. When sad, you will drink and sulk. When angry, you will lash out. This is because you live in a state of unrefined Shakti**, Shakti being the active principle of the Cosmos, in comoparison to the receptive state at Shiva.

They want you to be active. They want you to be unrefined immanent in your expression, and they want to keep you in focus. Put you in a desk from the time you're five years old until you're 18. And they tell you every day, shut your fucking mouth. Watch the teacher. Listen to what I have to say. Don't fucking get up and look out the window. Fuck the birds in the trees and the blue sky. You! You sit right here in this cold, barren piece of shit room that the government paid for. You listen to what we say and you do your work and you don't divert your attention anywhere because if you do, we'll give you a pill and we'll send you to the principal's office. And if you become too much of a problem, we'll kick you out of the school because we don't want the other kids seeing that

But there is another way. We want to escape that stay as soon as possible. We want self-control, and we cannot have that until we bring Shakti into OUR power.

When we allow Shakti to dictate the way that we behave, we are in a state of COMPULSION. And ultimately, the Right-Hand Path is all about removing compulsion, so that when we reach the Left-Hand Path we can engage with INDULGENCE

There is a big difference between those two

Compulsion means you don't have a choice

Indulgence means you choose. You regain your humanity. You are able to express your will and you are free from a state of reactivity

#### How do we do this?
Through two initial practices:
- Pranayama Nadi Shodhana - we bring into balance the two pranic channels, of Shiva and Shakti, and bringing them into balance. When brought into balance, we are at the point of unification as intention. At this stage, EVERYTHING in life becomes Yoga. We are practicing Magic now. You can call us yogins, you can call us yogis, you can call us magicians or witches or warlocks or wizards, whatever the fuck you want to call us. It doesn't matter, because we're doing one thing. We are applying our will in a process of transformation. That's what we're doing
- Trataka: the candle gazing meditation. We have a passive focus point with trataka. And with that passive focus point, we can begin to chip away at all the damage that society has done to us by forcing us into a state of one pointedness. We have to escape that. We have to be able to see the forest for the trees. We need to be able to simultaneously see the beautiful forest, see the blue sky, hear the birds chirping, smell the air, smell the leaves in the air. All of it. We need to experience all of it at once. And we can draw our attention, our awareness, to different elements around us, but not be so intensely focused that we lose sight of everything else. We need to be able to access that point of passive awareness, and we need to make that state of passive awareness into our primary operating state so that we can finally free ourselves from the rat race

Consistency is key to escape years of brainwashing in the system. You do Pranayama and you do Trataka, and you do it every day. Experiencing that beautiful freedom for just 10 minutes each day is enough to overcome years of system bullshit. That freedom, that power, is so sweet that it overruns all of that weak magic that's been forced upon you. It has nothing on the fire that's in your belly, or the will that's in your heart.

You do this until you realize that somebody has been pulling a veil over your eyes and suddenly it's removed and you can see again

Now, there is no turning back. You are on the mountain. The only way that you can fail at this point is to stop climbing. There is no going back once the illusion is broken. Then you begin the process and that's when you ascend up the Mountain.

As you advance through each state of consciousness, you gain awareness of that which already exists within you. At each state we clearly see what is keeping us grounded, what is keeping us from moving forward. We identify the maladjustments and we power through them and integrate them. Once we have truly adjusted it, we move into the next state.

So you go from Muladhara to the Svadhisthana, to the Manipura, Anahata, Vishuddhi, Ajna, to the  Sahasrara, applying these principles at each state. And when you reach the Sahasrara, your goal is to have a clear light experience, to reach transcendence, to kill the ego, you have to die so that you may be reborn on the Left-Hand Path.

There will be a natural tendency for the Kundalini energy, the Serpent Power, to want to continue to rise. As you get closer to eliminating maladjustments at each state, you're going to start to experience signs that it's time to move on to the next.

If you move forward prematurely, you'll have to go back and address those compulsions that are holding you down and keeping you from reaching transcendence.

it's very important, if you're going to be in an independent practice, to be very honest with yourself, to determine whether or not you truly have eliminated those maladjustments

But there will be signs


*resumir*:
Ultimately, over the course of the right hand path practice. Your goal will be to feel less and less attached to this dimension of consciousness. Less and less attached to your individuated expression of ego. Now, this is dangerous because it can lead to a lot of turmoil. For one, when you begin the process of. Excuse me. When you begin the process of freeing yourself from the entanglements of the system. That's going to piss off a lot of people. Because most people are cowards. They will not take action to change their circumstances. They will not take risks. They will toe the line. They'll be a good little boy, good little girl. And do everything that the system tells them to do. And if you start to break free, which you will start to do if you practice kundalini, if you start to break free, people will, one, become very jealous of you. Two, they'll feel like they no longer have control over you. So they'll want to get you under their thumb again. And three, they'll feel like there's pressure now on them to be better. And they don't want to be better. They want to remain in their comfortable cage. But you can't let those people hold you back. Once you have set the intention to realize your Dharma and to master the self, you have to continue. Anything else is failure. Failure is not an option. So you have to be aware of the fact that when you begin this process, it can cause a lot of trouble. It can cause a lot of social trouble. It can cause you to reassess your own nature. And it can expose things about you that you don't want exposed, that you don't want to confront. But you must remember throughout the whole process that ultimately, so long as you are pursuing your Dharma, you are living perfectly. And you are doing what is best for you. And what is therefore best for all those you love. Because if you cannot be a fully expressed version of yourself, if you cannot know the self, then you can only love as a half measure. You can only hate as a half measure. You can only experience the cosmos as a half measure. And anyone who truly loves you, anyone who truly appreciates your individuated expression within the cosmos. Your line in the cosmic symphony is going to want to experience the full thing, everything that you have to offer. Your total expression, the flame burning strong. So you have to hold that, you have to hold that awareness with you. You have to keep that flame. You have to bear that torch in the darkness and run with it and hold it. And know that if you reach the peak of the mountain, no matter what is on the other side, it is worth pursuing. Because ultimately it is you. Whether your Dharma is to unify with God or to become an individuated being fully realized, it's you, it's what you were meant to be. And so it is worth pursuing



If you're going to really walk the Left Hand Path, you have to achieve ego death. Because the Left Hand Path begins when you are reborn

And if you haven't gone through that baptism in the sun and achieved ego death, you are not a Left Hand Path yogin.

The Right Hand Path is not a lifestyle. It is a method for achieving a very specific goal. That goal being ego death, mastery of the self. Once you have achieved this, then you may walk the Left Hand Path until you have achieved ego death. Even if you call yourself a Left Hand Path magician, you are not a Left Hand Path magician. The Right Hand Path requires dealing with all of our attachments, all of our compulsions, in each element of the self, in body, in inner fire, in mind, in spirit and everything in between. We have to assess each state of consciousness. We have to expand our awareness, that is the Tantric element. We are expanding our awareness of these states. We're coming into full realization of the self. Because you can't deny the self, you can't reject the self, you can't kill the ego unless you know what it contains. And once you know what it contains, you can kill it. And once you've killed it, then you have released yourself from compulsion. You have released yourself from that which is destructive. In shakti, the unrefined Shakti, you've gone through a process of refinement. And then at that point when there is unification between Shiva and Shakti, then you begin the Left Hand Path at the Anahata
