# Cybertantra
System of reading: jumping from book to book (deep hyperlinking as in the Bible)

[[Intro (provisional)]]
%%The intro emphasizes the "liquid" nature of the book, where you can jump from section to section, but clashes with the manifesto so needs to be reworked. It's also not very inspired. It should also ask the reader to read on if he doesn't understand concepts%%
## Book I: Cybertantra

1. **The Modern Condition**
%%G: Manifesto is excellent but needs to be trimmed a little, need to find a way to make it flow through the next sections, which were written before it, starting with the present age%%

%%G: Another issue is I'm not sure how in depth we want to go into these concepts. Make it as exhaustive as possible or trim it to the max%%
