okay tonight we're going to talk about the concept of the esoteric anchor this is really a heavily occulted concept because there's been this idea within esoteric thought in the East and the West that if you expose the concept of the anchor you somehow robbed the initiate of the experience of developing a connection to the left hand path but I have found that that is actually [ __ ] you can speak about the anchor openly and it doesn't cause any sort of disturbance in the development of the initiate because these concepts are inherently occulted you can talk to people openly and freely about the nature of the right-hand path and the left-hand path and it doesn't mean that they're going to understand understand the full significance of what you're expressing I mean I've seen this consistently and I have been probably the most open practitioner of the left-hand path in history so um I see no problem with exposing this information and even if someone has a problem with it I don't give a [ __ ] I'm just going to say it anyway the anchor is the foundation of the left-hand path practice if you're your goal is to express your Consciousness imminently if you are to maintain your individuated nature you do so through the conduit of the anchor and so we're going to talk about what the anchor is and how you can create one okay so the anchor is the thing that connects you to individuated Consciousness and that can be anything but the important aspect to understand is that the anchor must be something that is highly significant to the individual and it has to be dharmic because if your anchor is not connected to your Dharma it will not be strong enough to allow for preservation of consciousness beyond the Transcendent point which we can also refer to as death but it's not just death also within the Kundalini practice we have the advancement on the right hand path to the Transcendent point and at the Transcendent Point there's a test the test is whether or not you can preserve your Consciousness Beyond dissolution and this is something something that is woven into the fabric of every great Aryan tradition there are myths that deal with this specifically there are Concepts that are inherently related to the idea of developing a dharmic connection to one's own nature so that that nature can be expressed into godhood now just as in aside in order to clarify what I mean by godhood I mean the preservation of individuated Consciousness beyond the cycle of time so this is escaping the Yugi cycle uh and escaping the yogic cycle means that you are no longer subject to the will of the shift from the point of differentiation in the kuga to the point of unification in the Satya Yuga you exist beyond all of these Expressions so if we want to exist beyond all these Expressions we have to have a means of achieving godhood or the Eternal expression of the ego and the best way to do this is through the anchor as I said the anchor can be anything but it has to be something that is significantly tied to your Dharma so let's go through some examples of anchors and specific Traditions that speak about the anchor okay probably the most common anchor within modern yogic practice is the guru the guru is the individual who Garners such trust and reverence with the disciple that upon experience of the Transcendent point the connection with the guru allows for the preservation of individuated Consciousness this is very common in the Tibetan tradition so the Tibetan uh Buddhist tradition emphasizes bakti on the guru and so there is a deep connection to the anahata in this practice what occurs is there's a meditation on the guru which Cycles through the Transcendent chakras to the anahata where the guru is pictured and a deep connection is formed at that point the guru then got guides the initiate through the Transcendent point and pulls them back to individuation so for most people if they're approaching the Transcendent point if they don't have an anchor that's it they dissolve they return to Oneness or they move into Oneness depending upon your perception of the Prime state the guru is the key in the Tibetan tradition of accessing States beyond the cycle of time now the guru can guide the initiate to Nirvana or they can guide the initiate towards an expression of individuated Consciousness in different forms and so the part th the Tibetan Book of the Dead is an example example of a guide book a magical text which allows for the formulation of the proper relationship between the guru and the initiate in facing the clear light So within the Book of the Dead we see that the guru provides instruction direction to the initiate upon death well this death is an esoteric death so of course the Book of the Dead can be used at the time of physical death to direct the initiate towards some specific outcome but it can also be utilized in a Kundalini practice so that once the initiate reaches the point of transcendence which is a metaphysical death death of the ego they can be guided back and they're not lost to Transcendence just to make sure that I'm clear with what I mean by lost to Transcendence I'm speaking specifically of those individuals who either die as a result of the Kundalini practice because they are absorbed into the clear light or the those individuals who remain within a Transcendent state in the sahasra and they do not return to imminence so if the goal of the initiate and the goal of the initiate is very important in this if the goal of the initiate is to maintain individuated Consciousness and reach the left-hand path there are specific steps that should be taken by the Guru in order to lead the initiate towards the imminent State and the Tibetan Book of the Dead describes these steps now it's occulted because within that tradition there's a bias towards the first initiation just as in any Aryan tradition there's a bias towards the first initiation and the first initiation focuses on Transcendence there is in inherent occulted aspects to the left-and path so with the first initiation we have this intense focus upon reaching the clear light and achieving Nirvana and so if you read the book of the Dead this is the bias that you're going to see but if you apply the doctrine of inversion to understand the text you'll find that in fact the Book of the Dead also offers a pathway to imminence and the imminent expression is something that becomes available when the initiate sets their intentions towards godhood expressing individuated Consciousness beyond the cycle of time the guru must understand the intention of the initiate before they guide them through the process whether this is at the time of physical death or through the metaphysical death that is achieved through a Kundalini practice at this point the guru is relied upon because to achieve total disconnect from all attachment you have to rely on an external Force to remove you from the clear light let's just backtrack a bit and consider what is being approached on the right hand path you're approaching removal of attachment and so to remove attachment you must remove desire you must remove compulsion now there are natural compulsions we are naturally compulsive beings because we have have that connection to the body the body in its purest expression the purest expression of Earth and the muladar is compulsion when we speak about the muladar we're talking about those aspects of the self that are innate and involuntary and so through this involuntary expression we develop these compulsions which are the basis for certain Act action but if we want to escape the material foundation and reach the Transcendent point of pure Spirit we have to be able to remove ourselves from those compulsions we can do this by giving ourselves to an external Force this external force is the anchor in the Tibetan tradition within the Book of the Dead the anchor is the guru we are giving ourselves to the guru so that he can guide us and we have total trust in him to guide us back so that when we throw ourselves willingly into the clear light and we achieve total Transcendence and removal of all desire all compulsion everything totally dissolved he grabs us and pulls us back there must be a very very strong connection between the guru and the initiate for this method to be effective there has to be love deep passion between the guru and the initiate and this is why there's such an intense focus on the anahata within that tradition because you're developing that passionate expression of a connection between two individuals in this path that's one method but of course there are many methods for achieving the development of an anchor let's talk about the Germanic tradition let's talk about Vahala the anchor to the imminent expression of the self within Valla is the ancestors and heroic death if you place your intention towards cultivation of a healthy relationship with your ancestors with the idea of heroic death and you put all of your energy into this and you develop the necessary Karma to have a connection to heroic death you have passion love for this your entire being is directed towards heroic death then upon death even though you lose yourself you lose lose your compulsions because you're willing to sacrifice yourself in battle to this Transcendent cause your connection to the imminent expression of War of battle gives you a bridge to the next World to the next plane of existence this is the anchor of Vahala let's talk about the anchor of mathuna or tantric sex if you develop an intense passionate love for another human being that love held by your partner provides you with an anchor that gives you the means of expressing the self into eternity and so even when you approach the clear light willingly and you throw away all compulsions that person their connection to you their pronic connection remains true it holds strong in the face of death and they pull you back they pull you into an imminent expression outside of the cycle of time this is something that is cultivated through love deep love now if you think about the significance of love and how it can pull you back you can charge anything with that type of passionate connection that gives you a bridge to immortality take for example the artist who feeds every ounce of their being into an artistic work that is representative of their nature their Dharma in its fullest expression and that artistic work brings them to the point of immortality they have placed such an intense karmic weight upon this work they have driven so much pra into the expression of this work that they build this anchor through this expression whether it's music or painting or carving or a great book that has been written there is so much power directed towards this thing that it is the anchor to bring that person towards immortality but if if you're going to approach the clear light if you're going to approach Transcendence if you're going to approach physical death you have to meet certain standards one standard is you have to be able to look at yourself in the mirror and say I am worth preserving I can live with myself in my present being for eternity also you have to be able to say that the thing I'm directing my energy towards my Prana towards I love it so much I hold so much passion for this thing that I trust it with my very existence and I'm not talking about trust trusting something with your life I mean your very existence beyond the point of dissolution if you can find something that you trust that much that you love that much and if you recognize your own value your own significance as an individuated being then you can know for certain that you will achieve [Music] [Music] godhood
