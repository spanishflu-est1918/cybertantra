Good & Evil is not part of Aryan tradition

Dualistic morality
-> A product of monotheism
-> Fundamental aspect to abrahamic religion

Suggests there's an objective form of good and evil
- Individuals who do good works are rewarded
- Individuals who do evil works are punished

There's a debate: are you redeemed by faith or works?

Fundamental idea:
There’s a Lawgiver and their dictate. If you abide, you’ve taken a good action. If you don’t obey, you’ve taken an evil action

The proxiologic argument by Skyler
- no intelligent being will take an action unless there is an unfulfilled desire. If all desires are fulfilled, there’s no need for action
- Yahweh takes action
- Any God who applies a standard of objective morality is taking an action, therefore they possess unfulfilled desire: passing judgement among beings
- That God reveals they are incomplete

 The proper understanding of action as it relates to what is good or evil is found in the tradition of Karma. Way more complex than the petty moralism of objective dualistic morality within the monotheistic traditions of modernity.

**Karma is the Yoga of action and consequence**

A system of analysis. You examine action, observe consequence and determine Karma

Karma is inherent to the nature of an individual

You have a Dharma or nature and you can take action that is either good or bad karma. If it brings you into alignment, that is Punya. 

This is different to good and evil, because it’s not objective

Remember Joker embracing their Dharma by feeling the good karma when dancing



**What is the consequence of failing to pursue one’s Dharma**
Depends on condition. Think of the businessman’s story. 
Within a system that is adversarial to your nature it’s very difficult to develop

Here’s where transcendence comes into play

There are certain conditions that require the accumulation of bad karma to elevate one self

Escape the framework of El. Embrace adharmic action too. If you’re living, your dharma is to die. If you go against your nature, you can achieve transcendence and escape the cycle of time

Apply order to your creative expression in full realization of the self
