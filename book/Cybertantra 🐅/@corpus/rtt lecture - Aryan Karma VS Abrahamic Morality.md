the concept of Good and Evil is not a part of the Aryan tradition this is something that was introduced much later by abrahamic Scholars who reinterpreted Aryan myth to incorporate dualistic morality dualistic morality is a product of monotheism specifically the abrahamic tradition includes dualistic morality as a fundamental aspect so when I say dualistic morality what exactly do I mean dualistic morality suggests that there is an objective form of good and an objective form of evil and typically when dualistic morality is presented there is this idea that those [Music] individuals who do good works are rewarded in the afterlife and those individuals who do evil works are punished in the Christian tradition there's some confusion regarding the nature of good and evil as it relates to heaven and hell because there is a debate between those who believe that you are Redeemed by faith alone or you are Redeemed by Works within the Catholic tradition you are Redeemed by works so you must accumulate over time the necessary good works in order to be worthy of Heaven if you do not accumulate the necessary good works you may either end up in purgatory or if you Embrace sin and you are an evil person you will be sent to Hell the Protestant tradition is primarily a Redemption by faith tradition and the idea is that that simply by accepting Christ as your savior you are a good person so it doesn't matter how many evil things you have done throughout your life if you give yourself to Christ you have achieved the necessary condition to be accepted into heaven now within the various other abrahamic Traditions there are other forms of sin and Redemption but the basic idea is that there is an essential lawgiver the monotheistic God who provides a framework for right and wrong action that is absolutely objective if you go against the dictate of the lawgiver you have taken an evil action objectively and if you abide by the dictate of the lawgiver you have taken a good action objective so the entire system of dualistic morality as we understand it as it exists within the framework of our present dimension of Consciousness is dependent upon this lawgiver and the authority of the lawgiver is dependent upon said lawgivers status the only reason why anyone would want to obey the dictate of a God in terms of obeying the law of a objective good and evil is if that lawgiver is an essential being meaning that he is omnipotent all powerful the foundation of everything because if there is an objective definition of right and wrong action that is applicable to the cosmos it must come from an essential Source now this raises the question of action as it relates to a monotheistic God and I created an argument that I call the praxiological argument against dualistic morality which demonstrates the absurdity of good and evil as is represented within the abrahamic tradition and any tradition that Embraces a monotheistic Creator God and it goes like this praxiology is a study of action there is an axiom within praxiology that no intelligent being will take an action unless there is an unfulfilled desire if all desires are fulfilled there is no need for Action the god of the Bible Yahweh who is the foundation of all understanding of objective Good and Evil Within the present age takes action in fact by acting as a judge of what is right or what is wrong any God not just Yahweh but any God who applies a standard of objective morality to all things within the cosmos any God who says this is always right and this is always wrong and I have the final say that God is taking an action therefore that God possesses unfulfilled desire in this instance it is the desire to pass judgment on other beings and because that God has taken the action of passing judgment on other beings that God has shown itself to be incomplete in the sense that that God is not an essential being it is not all powerful omnipotent primordial Oneness any aspect of primordial Oneness must also exist with the opposing force of differentiation if that aspect of Oneness is going to engage in any sort of interaction but of course anything anything at all that passes judgment is taking an action even if that thing is Brahma or Saturn or L these beings are representative of order they are lawgivers but they do not possess the authority that is granted to a figure like Yahweh within the abrahamic tradition because the proper understanding of action as it relates to what is good or what is evil is found within the tradition of Karma and karma is a tradition that is far more complex than the petty moralism of objective dualistic morality within the monotheistic traditions of modernity so in order to understand the Aryan perspective on Good and Evil what is bad and what is good you must understand karma karma is simply put the yoga of action and consequence or you can say action and reaction you can consider it excuse me you can consider this to be a system of analysis where you examine action and You observe the consequence and you can then determine the karma of that action for example I take my hand and I place it within a fire and I burn my hand so the action that I took was to place my hand inside of the fire and the consequence of that action was I burned my hand this is karma now most people would say immediately you burned your hand that's bad karma but that's not how Karma works and this is going to get really complex and there's a lot of layers to this so I'm going to be as clear as possible in describing how Karma manifests under different conditions and what's very important is to understand the conditional aspect of karma because it is highly dependent upon the Dharma of the individual and the conditions surrounding the individual karma is inherently related to Dharma or the nature of an individual so for example if my nature is to be a painter that is my artistic expression within the cosmos my nature is to be a painter and I take action that is against my nature at this level which is the basic level of karma this is what we would call pop or Bad Karma and if I am to take an action that is to bring me in alignment with my nature as a painter this is Huna or Good Karma now this is the dharmic Approach at its Mo most basic level and it is in relation to the individual the individual's nature is identified and once their nature is identified that which is against nature is po that which is in accordance with nature is funa now this is different from Good and Evil because obviously it is not objective objective definitions of Good and Evil state that this particular action such as for example child sacrifice child sacrifice is considered to be evil by most people objectively though and let's say um charity charity is an action that is considered to be objectively good by most people but within the Aryan tradition of karma we would say well first we must examine the nature of the person to determine whether or not child sacrifice is evil or charity is good perhaps the nature of the person states that Puna is achieved or good karma is achieved through child sacrifice and pop or bad karma is achieved through charity because the Dharma of the individual requires specific action in order to see that that Dharma is realized but of course it gets more complex than that because the question then arises what makes expression of one's Dharma good or bad maybe we can state that expression of Dharma is neither Puna or Po and so we have to consider once again the nature of action and consequence which is what we're dealing with when we're talking about Karma so what would be the consequence of failing to pursue one's Dharma well that is dependent upon condition let me give you an example let's say that you were born to be a businessman it is your Dharma to be a businessman and you're operating within an economic system where the banks have total control of the flow of monetary resources and are able to determine whether or not you can do business based upon your willingness to sacrifice yourself to the banking system but you were born to be a businessman what does it mean to be born to be a businessman maybe the type of businessman that you were born to be requires that you trade in monetary resources but you do so with a high level of autonomy a high level of Independence but the conditions that surround you have made it impossible for you to utilize monetary resources because the banking system has become so monolithic that they have control over all monetary resources they've made it impossible for you to achieve a full expression of what your Dharma is because if you are going to utilize monetary resources you have to give up your autonomy you have to give up your Independence and you have to sacrifice yourself to the banking system and so at this point you're stuck it seems like you can't realize your Dharma and inevitably you're going to accumul ulate pop because no matter what decision you make if you decide to not participate in monetary trade because it requires that you give away your autonomy you are not realizing your Dharma so you could say this is Bad Karma and if you choose to participate in the banking system and you give up your autonomy but you do this because you need access to the monetary resources once again you're not realizing your Dharma conditionally it becomes impossible to accumulate Puna and so the question is how can you possibly develop yourself as a powerful being within a system that is naturally adversarial to your nature and this is where Transcendence comes into play you would say at its most basic level that it's good to accumulate Puna it is good to accumulate Good Karma however this is a limiting belief because there are certain conditions that require the accumulation of bad karma in order to elevate oneself let's consider another conditional aspect the conditional aspect of the credit score system once again we're talking about banking we're talking about Finance as an example the credit score system so karma does not just exist as a macro system it exists on the micro scale as well obviously action and reaction is something that is accessible in multiple layers like for example if I rack up a lot of credit card debt and I fail to pay back my debt the reaction I'm getting from my action will be my credit score will plummet now if the goal within that system that specific order that box is to possess a good credit score then the action I have taken is Bad Karma I am not taking the necessary action to achieve a positive outcome within the credit score system however if my goal is higher than that for example if I take an adversarial stance to the bank the banking system to the economic system and I'm seeking Liberation from that system and I decide to utilize loopholes within the credit system to screw over credit card companies and tank my credit score but utilize the resources that I gain from doing so to liberate myself from that system then in fact I am accumulating Good Karma because I'm pursuing my higher nature we all possess the potential for higher nature Beyond any given system the example that I gave earlier of the man who was born with the Dharma to be a businessman and work with money but has been denied that opportunity by the banking system yes he does possess this specific Dharma but he also possesses a higher nature a spirit that goes Beyond this specific conditional aspect that he was born into and realizing that he possesses that higher nature he can accumulate Bad Karma within the present system that actually leads to the accumulation of Good Karma on the macro level and this gets kind of confusing because you have to start keeping track of what level you're operating on with Karma and whether or not you are ultimately serving the highest possible purpose which would be the highest Dharma or elevation of the self to the greatest power because ultimately Dharma is power and funnily enough the man who is born to be a businessman working with money who rejects the power that is offered to him by the system because he realizes that it is not in total alignment with his nature he is actually undermining his power in the present condition but but he is serving his power in the higher condition and therefore he is accumulating Karma towards Liberation in the form of transcendence this system can be taken to the ultimate level of recognizing Brahma being The Giver of law or the differentiated manifestation of primordial Oneness primordial in the sense that you're taking a bias that Oneness is the prime state which most people are born into this understanding if you're taking this perspective then if you want to transcend Brahma which means becoming more powerful than time more powerful than death then you have to be willing to accumulate Bad Karma on every level but the highest level and even at the highest level you have to be willing to reject that because ultimately Karma Huna and pop are aspects of duality and if we are to achieve the purest level of transcendence we have to recognize that there is no such thing as good karma or Bad Karma it goes beyond rejecting good and evil because good and evil is an absurdity and we can recognize that it is an absurdity just through pure logic we can recognize that it is an absurdity but karma is not an absurdity yet it becomes an attachment and if you are going to re release all attachments and Achieve ultimate Transcendence which is to escape the cycle of time and defeat death defeat this orderly aspect of the cosmos you have to be willing to give it all away this is accepting the ultimate poison which is realizing that everything that we see is good on a basic level becomes inhibiting if it's all that you know the true test is to put your hand in the fire and not get burned and this is only possible if you can escape the framework of Brahma or Saturn or L this is only possible if you are willing to embrace adarma if you are willing to go against your Dharma as a born individual because if the action is birth the karmic reaction is death if you are a living being your Dharma your nature is to die so so if you are to escape death if you are to escape Karma you have to go against your nature which is to die you have to go against your Dharma you have to accept Bad Karma and in accepting Bad Karma you have to recognize ultimately that this accumulates Good Karma and they cancel one another out they're dissolved into one another and that is when you achieve transc descendance and you escape the cycle of time this is the total Liberation where you become the one who possesses order who applies order to their creative expression in full realization of the self [Music]
