okay so tonight we're going to discuss Shiva now Shiva is a very very complex figure within the Indian tantric tradition so for this lecture I'm going to provide a general introduction to Shiva and we're going to touch upon some of his elements um in the future I plan to address each of these elements individually ually within lectures because there's so much richness to this God that uh each element deserves at least an hour of discussion so with this I just want to give you an overview of the nature of Shiva discuss some of the iconography and then we'll have a a Q&A about everything we discussed here and like I said we can talk about these other elements in great depth tonight but I will be covering them in individual lectures so uh Shiva represents the divine masculine within the Indian tantric tradition and his counterpart his consort is shaki so if we are to place these two on the spectrum of Consciousness as represented by the chakras we would Shiva in his pure form at the sahasra and Shakti in her pure form at the muladar now um I say pure form because both Shiva and Shakti have various incarnations and I'll discuss just a couple of shiva's incarnations tonight I won't get into all of them because there are there are many many incarnations and they all have very significant attributes that deserve a longer discussion but I will discuss just a couple of the uh more prominent forms um but just as shaki has many forms such as the the mahavidyas um Khali Kamala and all those forms Shiva has the same type of manifestations and each of these manifestations are representative of different forms of Consciousness as expressed through Shiva but Shiva also has a very interesting element in his manifestations in in that he relates to the material world through his consorts so he has various consorts um and they all tend to represent a feminine uh form of his contemplative nature so it's like the contemplative element the Transcendent element within the material form and that is where you get the relationship between Shiva and his consorts but these relationships vary greatly depending upon the tantric tradition that you're referring to so in shaktism for example Shiva plays a very important role but his role is sort of secondary to shaki because Shakti is considered the ultimate expression of God within the within the shaki tradition um in the shite and visha tradition Shiva is emphasized uh obviously with much greater importance because those Traditions are oriented more towards Transcendence and when we're discussing Shiva ultimately his nature is Transcendence Transcendence meaning that he is a pure representation of spirit and spirit being uh an element of unification is ultimately related to order bringing things into order bringing things under control suppressing the chaotic element which is the purest form of the divine feminine and so it is through this urge towards control and unification that Shiva is known as the Yogi or the originator of yoga so all yogic practices within the tantric mythology points back to Shiva Shiva operating as a manifestation of the Divine masculine within a differentiated Cosmos must create order from the chaos that surrounds him that is his mission that is his goal it's his Dharma to create order and order in this sense is created through self-mastery unification Yoga Yoga is the union that is achieved through the ascending path the self-mastery and so from Shiva we have the asinas Shiva teaches the ASAS he teaches the yogic path he teaches any element that leads to refinement because as I said ultimately his purest expression is that unifying point and so to refine things to take them and bring them into alignment this is the urge but it is expressed in an individuated context whenever we take the Divine masculine and we place it in the age of Shakti and I discussed that in previous lecture the fact that the Divine masculine element is transformed by its presence in an age of divine feminine power so when we're discussing all of these various elements of Shiva we have to keep in mind that while ultimately his Essence is unification and return to Oneness the Transcendent point he must operate within the material within the present dimension of Consciousness he must operate within shocky and so he does have a differentiated form and by observing this differentiated form we can learn how to better bring ourselves into alignment with unification and to achieve self-mastery through Ascension so let's talk about some of the elements of Shiva Shiva possesses a third eye and shiva's thirdd eye is quite interesting because usually it remains closed it remains closed because this represents for one the drive towards introspection due to his contemplative nature and also the fact that if he opens his eyes so if he brings introspection into the present dimension of Consciousness it is a destructive act and so in the tantric mythology when Shiva opens his third eye everything he sees is reduced to Ash and specifically the third eye of Shiva is associated with the destruction of Kama Kama is uh pleasure or desire and so when we think of about this in terms of a yogic practice Shiva offers the means by which we can overcome attachment to Kama many of you I'm sure all of you have heard of the Kam Sutra uh the Kamas Sutra is a book that discusses the concept of Kama and pleasure and how to uh integrate it in a dharmic fashion well um Shiva plays a very important role in this because if we're thinking about pleasure as it relates to Dharma pleasure can only be dhic or comma can only be dhic if it is not compulsive if it's compulsive then it is an attachment and it prevents us from achieving self-realization on the mountain on the yogic path so Shiva is an entity a being a deity that offers us a path towards bringing pleasure into alignment with Dharma well in order to do that in the traditional initiation of the right- hand path you have to sever all attachments to comma and so opening the third eye of Shiva means that you have destroyed all of these attachments you have destroyed the compulsions towards pleasure and desire which may act as a barrier towards your ultimate realization of Nirvana or realization of the self on the descending path so that is one very important element of Shiva now there are other elements of Shiva that are very similar to this uh this theme of self-mastery and that is one of those elements is the tiger skin so I mentioned this before but Shiva rides the tiger U but when he rides the tiger it is of a different nature than durja than Shakti when Shiva rides the tiger he's doing so through submission of the will of the tiger so in iconography of Shiva you'll often see that he is sitting on a tiger skin um and you contrast this with durja shaki who r es the tiger a living tiger she is sitting on the back of a living tiger so this is her Embrace of the shock the energy that drives the Modern Age Shiva is embracing the Tiger but he's doing so through submitting the will of the tiger so he has slayed the tiger he is he has destroyed the Tiger but he has kept the trappings of the tiger so this this means that Shiva is operating within modernity he's operating within the material world but he's doing so from a point of overcoming of a lack of attachment to that thing he has brought it under his will and this is yet another expression of shiva's drive towards self-mastery which is represented in his iconography now uh another important icon of Shiva is the vasuki vasuki is a Naga serpent deity that um rests on the neck of shivba and vasuki is the king of Naga he's very very powerful um and he grants blessings there is a myth of the um churning of the ocean of milk to extract Amita the nectar of the Gods within the Indian tantric tradition and and vuki um gives himself towards this task so he gives one end of his body to the DVA and one end of his body to the Asura so the these are like the Angelic beings and the Demonic beings and they utilize his body in order to churn together the ocean of milk and extract the amorita and what this represents is balance balance between the Angelic and the demonic aspects this is an element of overcoming um Duality because ultimately When You Reach unification when you're advancing towards that Transcendent Point you're achieving uh Liberation from Duality so Shiva exists in a non-dual state ultimately in his purest expression and by placing the serpent on his neck this is yet another example of his will towards achie achieving that balance the serpent also representing shaki any Serpentine uh figure within the Indian tradition has some element of shaki associated with it so by placing shaki around the neck Shiva is demonstrating his will towards achieving that balance balance between the DVA and the assura balance between Shakti and himself the throat of Shiva is very important um there's a myth of the poisoning of the World by A Great Serpent and Shiva takes the poison into his throat and purifies it and from this he gives uh pure water back to the Earth uh and this causes his throat to turn blue so there's an association between this myth of Shiva this certain Incarnation and the vishi because the vishi is the point point of purification and so with purification what you have is the transformation of poison into medicine I mentioned this time and time again that this is an essential idea within the Tantra tradition the idea that we take things that would under certain circumstances destroy us and we turn them into a source of power so with this myth Shiva is demonstrating his his ability to take elements of Destruction and turn them into elements of creation he's taking the poison turning it into medicine and that is achieved through the Transcendent path if he was unable to walk the transcending path uh or the Transcendent path he would be destroyed by those compulsions so you see there are so many elements of Shiva and this is just touching upon a few of them but there are so many elements that are all related to the idea of Ascension of self-mastery um the Trula is the Trident of Shiva and this is once again another element of balance between creation preservation and destruction these are the three prongs of the Trident and Shiva fulfills all of these roles in some degree um and he does so by bringing them into alignment into balance his creative aspect is the uh bringing things like yoga and art unification into the cosmos this is a creative aspect he is acting within the material world but he's also uh preserving he's trying to preserve the uh flow of time he's trying to preserve the uh Dharma towards alignment with Oneness and he's destroying things in the process because ultimately he is trying to destroy comma and in his purest sense he's trying to destroy all differentiation because differentiation is not order order is um the absence of chaos and you are going to have some element of chaos so long as you have a differentiated form so ultimately Shiva is trying to bring everything into ultimate order and he does so through destruction and the destructive elements of Shiva are seen in his dance so he carries the the dearu the drum uh the dearu is his link to his nataraja form nataraja is the cosmic dancer so you may have seen the statue of Shiva dancing this is a specific incarnation of Shiva I and in this Incarnation he does the tandava which is the cosmic dance the tandava is a dance of Destruction and it is distinguished from the lassia which is the feminine dance so the tandava is the uh masculine form of the cosmic dance where Shiva uh brings everything into dissolution this is the destructive aspect and the lasia is the dance that um is performed by Shakti and her dance is creative so she is trying to bring about differentiated form in her dance um but this destructive aspect is important because this is what helps to advance the flow of time Shiva is also associated with time just as mahakali is associated with time but his specific association with time is of a destructive nature the idea that everything must once again return to that monistic point or if you don't believe that the monistic point is Prime and I don't believe it's Prime I believe that it's impossible to say which state is prime then it is simply the advancement towards that monistic state so that's where he plays a role in the advancement of time Shiva is advancing us towards one oness and shaki is advancing us towards differentiation Shiva is advancing us towards order and for or excuse me order and shaki is advancing us towards differentiated form so that is the contrasting point now uh one more uh form of Shiva that I wanted to mention before we go to questions is Bava Bava is very interesting um Bava is essentially the agori Shiva he is is Shiva in The Cremation ground and he has a consort Name by rabi and so they are both agoris uh in this form Shiva is in his ferocious nature and what he what he is doing is he's manifesting as a muladar form so this is his um this is his uh adversarial Consciousness made made real and so bya is an agori and so he actually takes all poison he practices his asceticism through seeing no difference between any material form so this is a very important figure to the agoris because you know when you see an agori do something like eat brain matter from a corpse or something like that they're not seeing brain matter when they do this they're seeing Oneness they're seeing God they're seeing God in everything and it's a very vicious intense way of pursuing order and unification and so when Shiva manifests in this form even though his Consciousness is of a very imminent nature in the muladar it's colored by his essential Dharma which is towards order towards unification towards Transcendence and so it's important to recognize that even though we see Shiva as a differentiated figure as an active form uh as taking the form of baraba or some other ferocious manifestation ultimately everything that he does is colored by Divine masculinity which is order and a return to Oneness and this is the ultimate nature of [Music] Shiva
