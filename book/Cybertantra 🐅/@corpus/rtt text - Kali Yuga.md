## In the Kali Yuga

The spirit is a whisper in the howling wind.

Kali is the fiercest manifestation of Shakti. She possesses the ultimate power of destruction and creation. Her presence in the cosmos can be seen in the expansion of creative forces, as well as the increasing extremity of destructive forces. The mirror of creation is oneness, and creation itself is the process of objectification and differentiation. The dharma of the cosmos requires that all creation be born from destruction. In order to create, something must be consumed. This can be understood in terms of energy and output. One must consume energy in order to achieve a creative output. As Kali creates the universe, she is simultaneously causing great destruction. This is the sacrifice that must be paid in order to bring about the highest expression of creation.

Due to her destructive attributes, Kali is considered by some to be a negative or evil deity, and the Kali Yuga is often described as the worst of all yugas. To take this position is to disregard Kali’s great gift to the cosmos: beauty. In pursuing objectification and differentiation, Kali brings perceptibility to the cosmos. Without Kali, consciousness would never advance beyond the point of oneness; the universe would remain within the cosmic womb, forever ignorant of itself. Just as there is no creation without destruction, there is no pleasure without pain, and though Kali introduces great pain into the cosmos, she also brings great pleasure. She allows consciousness to perceive beauty; she gives meaning through contrast.

During the Satya Yuga, Kali is in a deep slumber. Creation and destruction are present as possibilities, but they have yet to be activated. It is the slow awakening of Kali that begins the cycle of creation and destruction. As the yugas advance, the presence of Kali is felt with greater intensity. The beginning of the Kali Yuga is marked by the point at which Kali is fully awake and her power can be experienced in its fullest expression. Kali produces the material world through objectification that separates certain elements from oneness. Oneness is the source of all spiritual experience, and the separation of oneness into various objects is a destructive process that causes the spirit to progressively retreat to the subtle expression. The oneness of the Satya Yuga is broken by Kali, and the material body that existed only as a possibility in the Satya Yuga eventually becomes the dominant form. The spiritual is supplanted by the material in terms of degree of perceptibility. While spirit consciousness is experienced directly in the Satya Yuga, this consciousness becomes increasingly elusive, until the recognition of spiritual consciousness becomes incredibly rare.

## Major and Minor Yugas

As a consequence of the retreat of the spirit to the subtle expression, there are many changes that occur in the cosmos. In order to understand these changes, it is necessary to differentiate between the Major Yuga and the Minor Yuga. Within each Major Yuga, there are Minor Yugas which reflect the macro-cycle. In the Kali Yuga, there is a Minor Satya Yuga wherein the spirit becomes more perceptible.

Much of the negative view of the Kali Yuga is rooted in the Bhagavata Purana, a text that is central to Bhakti Yoga and Vaishnavism. The Bhagavata Purana is a text that offers an alternative concept of dharma from what is found in the Vedas. There is a strong emphasis of transcendence over immanence, with devotion to Krishna offered as a preferred path of transcendence. The bias in favor of transcendence and bhakti can be seen in the description of the Kali Yuga that is found within the Bhagavata. This description focuses almost entirely on the adharma of the social body in the Kali Yuga.

### Predictions in the Kali Yuga

The Bhagavata makes the following predictive statements:
- Decline in bhakti, physical strength, lifespan, truthfulness, and memory.
- Material wealth determines individual value.
- Spirituality becomes hollow for most people.
- Clever language usage equates to scholarship.
- Formal marriage traditions dissolve.
- Personal hygiene declines.
- Sacred places lose significance.
- Material well-being dominates concerns.
- Religion is practiced to maintain reputation.
- Keeping a family together becomes rare.
- Overpopulation causes strain.
- Political power is gained through strength.
- Harsh taxation becomes normal.
- Food quality and security decline.
- Climate issues cause suffering.
- Mental health deteriorates.
- The elderly are abandoned.
- Greed fuels conflict.
- The priesthood is corrupted.
- Fools present themselves as spiritual experts.
- Cities become crime-ridden.
- Vedas are misinterpreted by atheists.
- Political leaders become parasites.
- Higher castes lose authority due to lack of self-mastery.

An assessment of these predictions in reference to contemporary society reveals an accurate description of the destructive aspects of humanity in the Kali Yuga. Despite this, one must consider the great power and beauty that may be gained by those who successfully "ride the tiger" during these trying times.

## Conclusion

In the Kali Yuga, the yogi endures pain for pleasure and suffers for beauty. The suffering of asceticism is endured to gain greater power. This is the nature of tantra. As the Kali Yuga advances, the extremity of differentiation increases, often beyond the average person's capacity to bear. This craving for escape from the material eventually leads to the dissolution of the material universe.

By understanding the cycles of time at both macro and micro levels, yogis can better navigate these changes and achieve greater harmony with the cosmos.
