Tonight I am going to discuss the invocation of Artemis. The invocation of Artemis is a ritual—it's a new tantric ritual that was developed based upon ancient tradition. I developed this ritual as a means of accessing the lycanthropic state. Within this lecture, I'm going to describe the tradition that informs the ritual, I'm going to describe the nature of lycanthropy as it relates to the ritual, and then I'm going to discuss in detail the process of actually conducting the ritual.

Like I said, the invocation of Artemis is a new ritual that is based upon ancient tradition. The reason why I felt the need to craft this invocation was because the lycanthropic state is very important within Tantra. The Greco-Roman tradition is essentially tantric in that the magic practices which are associated with that tradition integrate yoga. Now these practices are not called yoga, but it is Yoga nonetheless. It is Yoga because these practices utilize magic as a means of exploring consciousness and reaching unification—unification of the self, self-realization—and of course this looks different for different people.

So in examining the Greco-Roman tradition, I was able to identify a stream of development of lycanthropic magic that is made manifest in a very beautiful manner within the cult of Artemis. I'm going to describe within this lecture why I chose the cult of Artemis, but first what needs to be said is that the invocation of Artemis is ultimately a form of sex magic. It's Mathuna, but it does not have to be performed in an overtly sexual manner. You can actually perform this ritual independently. You can perform it with a lot of variation, and we're going to talk about that variation tonight.

The central question in terms of the magical process that is accessed through this ritual is this: What is lycanthropy, and why would we want to access the lycanthropic state? Lycanthropy is an altered state of consciousness that is explicitly associated with the muladar—which is partially a spiritual manifestation, but primarily it is a physical manifestation because it is associated with the muladar. Lycanthropy is a form of blood magic. It is a form of blood ritual. And whenever we enter into a lycanthropic state, we are accessing blood Prana as the vehicle for achieving that state.

There are many forms of lycanthropy, and we're not going to discuss lycanthropy in grave detail because that would require multiple lectures. But just for the sake of this discussion and in order to clarify what we are trying to achieve with this ritual, I'm going to give a basic outline of some of the major forms of lycanthropy.

You have the internalized expression of lycanthropy or lycanthropy that is subtly expressed. Most forms of lycanthropy—like for example, the psychological lycanthropy wherein an individual behaves in a very animalistic manner or sometimes they assume the behaviors of an animal without any sort of physical change—this is one type of lycanthropy and this is the most common type of lycanthropy. This is a form of the lycanthropic state that you can observe in, for example, a mental institution. There are people who are within mental institutions right now in the United States that operate from a lycanthropic state in this way.

Then you have the physical manifestation of lycanthropy, which is extremely rare but is possible to access through this ritual. And I have personally witnessed this, and I have also been informed by other individuals who have conducted this ritual that physical change is possible through the invocation of Artemis.

When we talk about physical lycanthropy, there's a broad spectrum of what a physical change might look like in a lycanthropic state. In its most extreme form, a physical lycanthropic state is an absolute change of the physical structure of the magician in order to assume the form of the animal that is being accessed through the ritual—like for example, the werewolf, which is probably what most people are familiar with in terms of lycanthropy. The idea is that if you were to achieve a full physical manifestation of werewolfism, you would actually transform into a wolf. This is one form, and this is also a form of lycanthropy that is accounted for in tradition all over the world—like for example, in the Americas you have the Windigo, and the Windigo is a lycanthropy that is expressed in a full physical manifestation.

On this spectrum of physical manifestation, you also have very subtle expressions of physical change—like for example, changes to the pupils of the eyes, changes to the teeth, rapid fingernail growth, rapid hair growth. These are all potential changes that can result from this ritual. These changes can either be sudden and can occur within the confines of the ritual space, or they can occur after the ritual has been completed. So there can be lingering effects of this invocation, and it's important to be aware of that.

So there can be lingering effects of this invocation, and it's important to be aware of that.

The lycanthropic state—how is it achieved traditionally? Lycanthropic states are achieved through multiple methods, but they all share blood as the primary pranic channel. For example, lycanthropic states can be achieved through ritual consumption of a potion, which could be like a combination of certain drugs that you would take. Lycanthropic states can be achieved through invocation, which could include the use of forms of Yoga Nidra or trance meditation. And traditionally, lycanthropic states can also be reached through infection of the blood.

I have personally witnessed lycanthropic states that have been brought about by use of substances and meditative states. I have not experienced infection, but if you consider the nature of blood prana and the pranic channel of the blood—if the essence of the thing is carried within the blood and that essence enters into an individual—then there is certainly potential for such a shift to occur.

Now, what are the uses, the potential uses of lycanthropy? Why would you want to enter into a lycanthropic state? Well, for one, a very intense lycanthropic state will allow you to reach a level of body awareness that is extremely intense, heavily rooted, very animalistic. And there are many uses for that state of consciousness.

For one, you can utilize it purely for exploratory purposes. So, for example, if you want to understand the full expression of the body, if you want to understand full expression of the muladar as a state of consciousness, you can do so through the invocation of Artemis, you can do so through a lycanthropic state.

Also, lycanthropic states have traditionally been utilized in warfare. For example, we have the Koros, and Koros is an ancient lycanthropic cult—an Indo-Aryan cult that utilized the lycanthropic state through blood prana ritual in order to improve their proficiency in combat. Similarly, we have the Norse Berserker Cults. The Berserker Cults utilized a combination of meditation and likely utilized drugs-induced states in order to achieve the Berserker state. This is another prominent warrior tradition within Aryanism that is heavily rooted in lycanthropy.

One other example is the Spartan Crypte, once again a lycanthropic cult sometimes associated with the wolf. All of these lycanthropic states that are achieved by these different cults—they allow an individual to become so ferocious in their expression, so furious that the animalistic state blocks out feelings of pain, eliminates hesitancy. There is a destruction of the inhibitions that would prevent someone from charging directly into danger and risking their body. That's something that is an important aspect of the muladar.

If you think about a charging elephant going straight into a battlefield, that is what is experienced within the consciousness of the warrior who enters into the lycanthropic state.

But there are other uses of lycanthropy. Like, for example, in sex ritual, if you seek to experience a very animalistic and rooted expression of sexuality. There's many reasons why you would want to do this, but if you seek to explore this element of sexuality, lycanthropy is one of, if not the strongest forms of muladar sexuality.

Then you have the use of lycanthropy as a means of connecting with nature. And this leads into the reason why I selected the Cult of Artemis as the foundation for this invocation. Because within the cult of Artemis, you have all of the major aspects of lycanthropy in one tradition: the warrior aspect, the sexuality, and the communion with nature.

Artemis is a goddess who is associated with the hunt, and the cult of Artemis is interesting in that the hunt is experienced on both sides. You have the hunter represented in ritual work, as well as the prey. Why would you want to represent the prey within a ritual consecration of the hunt?

Within the Aryan tradition, there is a very intense focus placed upon the sanctity of nature and developing a healthy and balanced relationship to the natural world. So within the invocation of Artemis, this element has been preserved.

If you examine the ancient cult of Artemis, you will see that this aspect has always been present in conducting ritual consecration of the hunt. Division was created in the ancient cult of Artemis between men and women. Men were given the role of the hunter in the ritual space, and women were given the role of the prey. While the men were on the hunt, the women would participate in a lycanthropic ritual.

As part of this ritual, these devotees of Artemis would enter into a frenzied lycanthropic state where they would assume the form of the animal that was the object of the hunt. This was done for multiple reasons, but all of these reasons involve developing a healthy relationship to nature.

One element of developing this healthy relationship to nature is the increase in compassion. Because if you assume the form of an animal that is to be hunted, you can experience what it means to be prey. Therefore, when you approach that animal within the confines of the hunt, you do so with the knowledge that this animal possesses a spirit that is worthy of respect. You develop empathy for that animal, and in developing this empathy, you are able to create an environment where the natural world is seen as something that should be held in high regard and something that should be managed effectively.

This is something that is lacking from much of the modern world because this type of ritual consecration of the hunt is very rare. Most people who engage with the natural world in a consumptive manner—meaning those individuals who eat meat—are totally detached from the origin of their food supply. Therefore, they don't understand from a compassionate perspective, from a standpoint of empathy, what the animal experiences. This is why you have the rise of factory farms and horrible conditions where animals are abused or neglected in the name of profit, because the spiritual element, the unifying element, is absent in the hunt.

Now it's interesting that this unifying spiritual element becomes accessible through a lycanthropic state because, as I said, the lycanthropic state is associated with the muladar. The adversarial state of the muladar is the sahasra, and by experiencing the blood, you gain access to a visceral expression of the animalistic state. But there is also the potential to access the other side of the spectrum of the muladar—which is the unifying aspect of the sahasra—which is coded into the experience.

That's one reason why the invocation of Artemis is so important in terms of exploring consciousness: because it is based upon this ancient practice of developing unity with nature, developing compassion for animals, understanding the source of what you consume.

Then you also have the sexual element. This occurs when the hunter returns and overtakes the woman who is now assumed this animalistic form. And in this way, the man dominates nature, but he does so from a standpoint of self-control and respect. Because in this instance, the female participant in the ritual has achieved a state of Shakti. She is in the chaotic expression of the muladar. The hunter represents Shiva—he is the Divine masculine expression representing order. So he introduces order through sexual expression. This is Mathuna—it is the bringing together of Shiva and Shakti through lycanthropic rites.

The sexual element is very interesting because if the man is operating from the position of Shiva, this is the sahasra. So the sahasra expressed within overt sexuality, indulgent sexuality—sex that is performed for pleasure because sexual pleasure is an important element of the ritual—then you have the spirit expressing the vulgar physical manifestation in the muladar.

There is an inversion point, as I stated before. The female participant who accesses the animalistic state is able to understand compassion through the opposite side of the spectrum at the sahasra. And the male participant who expresses order from the spirit is able to experience in the muladar release of inhibitions, pleasure to be released from stoicism, to experience the ecstasy of the hunt within the confines of sex magic.

Now there is another important aspect of the background of this ritual which needs to be understood, and that is the lunar aspect. The muladar is associated with the moon. It is the full moon, and the association between the full moon and lycanthropic states is no mistake. Because when you are accessing the muladar, you are accessing a purely lunar energy, and the moon influences the intensity of the lycanthropic state.

Most of you are probably familiar with folk tales about werewolves who transform on a full moon night. These stories are expressing the power of lunar energy. The moon is a mother energy, and it is Shakti. So we find within the cult of Artemis this lunar aspect. Artemis is associated with the moon, and this lunar aspect has been integrated into the invocation of Artemis.

Let's now discuss the specifics of the ritual. How do you craft the ritual? How do you perform it? How do you remain safe in performing the ritual—or at least as safe as you can possibly be if you're going to enter into a lycanthropic state?

The first step in performing the invocation of Artemis is to choose a specific animal form. You can select any animal form that you would like for the ritual, but it is important to recognize that the form you select is going to influence the consciousness experience of the ritual. You will be in the muladar when you practice this ritual. However, there are certain animals that can radically influence the coloring of your state of consciousness.

This is why lycanthropic states are typically associated with animals that are of a muladar nature, such as bears or wolves, because these animals offer a very pure expression of that Divine Fury and Chaos in Shakti. It is typically easier for an individual to experience the full animalistic expression of the muladar if they select an animal form that is of a muladar nature like a bear, a wolf, or an elephant.

If, however, you select an animal that is associated with another state of consciousness—let's say the manipura—you will experience the ritual from the muladar, but there will be an added element of the manipura energy. It will be like a muladar person operating within the manipura.

It's important—very important—to be aware of the consciousness element of the animal that you select for the ritual. Also, it's important that you are able to gain access to materials that will allow you to craft the necessary trappings to assume that animal form.

In order to perform the invocation of Artemis, you must create a ritual space that is associated with your selected animal. And the way that you do this is to craft a suit—a costume that is worn in order to aid in connecting with the animal. For example, if you wanted to assume the form of a wolf—werewolfism—you would gain access to materials associated with the wolf such as a wolf's pelt, teeth, claws, wolf's blood. All of these materials combined aid in the expression of a deepened pranic channel because we are dealing with blood Prana.

It is important to recognize the power of the physical material. It is possible to perform the invocation of Artemis with artificial materials such as artificial fur, but you're not going to be able to reach the deepened state that you are searching for. You'll be able to reach some state of lycanthropy, but maybe not the full expression that you're seeking.

So the closer you can get to the raw organic materials, the better experience you are likely to have. If you want to become a wolf, get the materials of a wolf. If you want to become a bear, get the materials of the bear. And when you do this, when you gather these materials, you begin to craft your suit.

For example, in the Berserker cult, which was often associated with the bear, the Berserkers would wear the bear pelt. And by having the skin of the bear, the fur of the bear on their body, they would gain access to the blood Prana of the bear. Also, consuming the flesh of the bear prior to the ritual would deepen the state.

So if you want to assume a specific animal form, it is helpful to consume its flesh prior to the ritual. You are absorbing the essence of that creature in your bloodstream, which gives you greater access to the pranic channel.

The ritual space is also highly influential. You want to ideally be within an environment that is natural to the animal form that you are trying to take on. So for example, if you're trying to take on the form of an aquatic animal, you would want to be in that aquatic space—like maybe a dolphin—you'd want to be in the ocean. Or if you're trying to assume the form of a coyote, you would want to be in the woods or in the desert.

Being in the wilderness space also offers the added benefit of a release of inhibitions because you're far away from the crowd, you're far away from civilization, and so you're able to express yourself with much more intensity without having to have concern for being identified by others, which is very important because this ritual can get fucking crazy.

Also, being in communion with nature—to perform this ritual in the wilderness means that you will have access to natural pranic channels in the soil, in the trees, in the waters—all these areas where these animals or this animal form that you're trying to take on treads that ground. So therefore, its presence is within the land.

You know, if you want to understand Egyptian culture with depth in the body, you go to Egypt. You experience the sands, you experience the pyramids, you go out amongst the people, you eat their food, you dress like them, and then you begin to understand with greater depth the nature of the Egyptian spirit or the Egyptian race. The same can be said for this ritual. If you really want to understand the essence of that animal, you have to inhabit its space.

However, you can perform this ritual indoors, and I've done it multiple times, and it's a fucking mess. So be very, very certain that you're willing to enter into a lycanthropic state in your living room before you wake up the next day to the biggest fucking goddamn mess you've ever seen in your life.

So you can do it, but just like with the suit that you create—if you're creating a suit from artificial materials, like for example, I guess you could go on Amazon and get the three-wolf moon t-shirt for your lycanthropic ritual to assume a werewolf form—man, that might be fucking powerful now that I think about it. That might even be better than an actual wolf's pelt.

But ideally, you'll want to get a wolf's pelt. Conducting the ritual within your home is sort of like introducing a detachment that might interfere with the full expression—in fact, it almost positively will interfere with the full expression of the ritual.

So ideally, you want to get out into nature, and you want to perform this ritual at night. If you really want to get fucking crazy, you want to perform this ritual under the full moon because that's when you're going to get the fullest expression of that lunar aspect. It can be performed at any time. You can perform this during the day, but if you want to get the top-dollar, high-ticket experience of being a fucking werewolf, you need to be doing this under the full moon at night in the woods with a wolf pelt, with wolf's blood, consuming the flesh of the wolf—all of these things need to be done together.

Also, one ritual element that you can utilize to really deepen the state is alcohol, because alcohol is associated with the muladar. When you get drunk, you enter into a muladar state. You can actually get so drunk that you can shift your consciousness completely into the muladar.

Now, the amount that you drink is up to you. If you feel like you can express this lycanthropic state with just a small amount of alcohol, do that. If you feel like you need to get super fucking drunk to do this, then do that. You don't have to use alcohol at all, but it is going to increase the potency of the pranic channel for most people.

So when you've got your wolf steak, your raw wolf steak, and you've got your wolf pelt on in the woods, and you've got your giant bottle of wine, and you're just getting fucking wasted, eating your wolf steak—that is a fucking experience.

I've created my own ritual music for this, which is on the Ride the Tiger Yoga Patreon and it's very effective. I've used it multiple times, it works really well. Other people have used it, it works really well. But you don't have to use my music—you can use whatever music you want.

However, I recommend that you use something that is very low frequency because the muladar is accessed at a low frequency. So really low frequency, droning music that gives you that animalistic feeling, pulls you down, makes you feel very grounded, very rooted—that's what you want to go for. Like Sun, the band Sun, the drone metal band—that's good fucking stuff you can use.

Once you have your ritual space together—which, by the way, like you can add other things to the ritual space too—like for example, the prey of the animal form that you want to take, like maybe rabbit carcasses or something like that, bones. Create a space that is similar to the den of the animal that you're trying to assume.

I don't recommend that you go into like a fucking cave where there might be bears or where there certainly are bears and perform this ritual, 'cause it probably ain't going to end well for you. But hey, if you got the fucking balls to do it, do it. I hope somebody does that. But I'm not recommending anybody does that. It's not my fucking fault that somebody gets hurt doing that. But it would be interesting if someone does do that. Please record it and send me the recording.

So once you have set up your ritual space and you have your ritual music, then you take all of your materials, you go to your ritual space, you don the skin. The dawning of the skin—this is the placement of the pelt, whatever you've created. A mask is good, especially if you want to take on a bird spirit. You can create a mask out of the feathers of the bird.

You put on the skin, then you perform the mulabandha. So once the music is starting, you've consumed the flesh, you've covered yourself in the blood of the animal, you drink the wine, you perform mulabandha. This is typically performed in siddhasana or siddhayoni, where you place pressure on the perineum and begin to visualize a pulse of deep red light at the perineum, which is the seat of the muladar.

You focus on that deep red light, breathing naturally, allowing everything to flow freely, not being distracted by any disturbances or any enticements, allowing everything to flow freely. You're bringing your awareness to that pulse, and then you begin to clench the muscles around the perineum in time with the pulse. That is how you perform mulabandha from siddhasana.

Now, this is not your typical mulabandha because within the confines of this ritual, what you're trying to do is bring your nature in alignment with the animal form that you're trying to take on. So let's say I'm trying to take on the form of a wolf. I'm in my ritual space, covered in wolf's blood, covered in the pelt, I'm practicing mulabandha.

As I deepen into the state and things get heavier and heavier, and I feel the light overtaking my body—visualizing deep red warm light expanding through my entire body, expanding outside of my body, slowly overtaking everything in my surroundings—that is when I begin to bring my awareness to the animal form that I am trying to assume.

I am drawing my awareness of this animal form to the muladar because that is the pathway of blood Prana. That is the gate. So I'm introducing the animal form. I'm visualizing the animal. I'm seeing the animal. I'm tasting the blood of the animal. It is around me, and I'm drawing this visualization, I'm drawing this awareness down, down to the root, down to the muladar.

What is happening—what is occurring when you do this—is you are manifesting the spirit of the animal within the blood, within your blood, within your physical being. It is a form of possession. You are being overtaken by the spirit of the animal—the spirit that resonates through the blood, through the hair, through the skin, the meat of that animal. You are allowing that essence to enter into you. It is a form of possession.

And once you do this, you begin to feel the presence of that spirit within you. Now most people would get scared shitless at this point and they would stop. They'd say, "No, no, no, fucking this. I'm not going any further. This is too much."

This is where you have to overcome fear and you have to trust yourself. You have to trust the ritual. You have to trust the container and allow yourself to be overtaken. You feel the animal spirit beginning to overtake you. You start to feel that you are becoming the animal. You're moving like the animal. Very shifts. You're beginning to feel your bones shifting, your skin shifting. Things are beginning to change.

At this point, you must give in to the change. You must take on the shift. You have to throw yourself into the expression. Release all inhibitions and begin to take on whatever form you're trying to reach. And so that can include vocalizations like howling of the wolf—some Duran Duran fucking—you can feel like you want to crawl on the ground, ride in the dirt. I've seen different forms of this. I've experienced different forms of this.

And at some point, you're going to be possessed by the spirit of the animal, and it's at this point that you have reached the full lycanthropic expression, whatever that might be for you. The intensity of the expression is really dependent upon the pranic channel. Some people are prone to very drastic shifts. Some people have very subtle shifts.

You can increase the intensity over time with practice, and not just practice in this invocation but practice in general yoga practice. You can bring yourself into a much deeper connection to those pranic channels, which will increase the intensity of what you have experienced. Just as one example, I know of one person who conducted this ritual and their pupils changed into the shape of a goat's pupils—the square pupils, which I think may have freaked out their partner a little bit.

Don't be surprised if you don't remember jack shit from the night that you conduct this ritual. I know one time I conducted this ritual and I had like a four or five hour block of no memory whatsoever of what had happened. And shit was fucked up. There was a god-awful mess to clean up after that.

But you need to be aware of the fact that this ritual can get extremely intense, incredibly intense. And whenever you reach that lycanthropic state, you might be aware of what you're doing. You might feel you might be able to see what's happening, but you're kind of on autopilot. You might have a little bit more control. It all just depends on the nature of the pranic channels.

Now, really intense tantric practice can lead to higher degrees of control over the experience, but for most people performing this, you're really at the mercy of your dharma at this point. So be aware of that.

Now the aspect of sex. First off, I'm just going to say right now if you're going to perform this ritual, you need to know that you're going to be in a state of possession. So the whole idea of consent and everything is really something that needs to be dealt with prior to you actually entering into this ritual.

If you're going to perform this as a sex ritual, you need to be fully aware that you're going to be in a drastically altered state of consciousness while you perform this ritual. That's something that you really need to consider carefully.

Traditionally, the woman would assume the lycanthropic state and the man would be the hunter—let's just use this as a baseline example. But adaptations can be made to this because this ritual is not limited to any specific sexual orientation. You can have multiple partners involved with this too. You can have a full-on orgy if you want to—full-on werewolf orgy, yeah.

What occurs is you have the individual who enters into the lycanthropic state, and then at some point during this, the hunter presents himself. We're going on an example of a female lycanthrope and male hunter. The hunter presents himself, and typically what happens is the lycanthrope will become very aggressive and attack or run off into the woods. The goal of the hunter is to chase down the lycanthrope, assert control, and assert some sexual dominance, and then you have sex. That's traditionally what occurs within the ritual.

Now that can look like a lot of different things. Like I said before, you ever practice this ritual, you need to be very clear about your intentions and be very aware of what may occur. Also, if I've not witnessed this, but if you are performing this ritual thinking that you're going to like have a good time and get lucky, and then your partner turns into a fucking werewolf—fully expressed physical werewolf—you should probably be ready for that.

And you know, like maybe not try and have sex with a werewolf. I mean, you could have sex with a werewolf if you want—a fully physically manifested werewolf—but it might not end well for you. So just know that's a possibility.

Like I said, you can perform this ritual in many different ways. You can actually perform this ritual where both individuals assume the lycanthropic form. Now that's pretty dangerous because nobody's monitoring anything, but it's possible. You can also perform this independently and you can remove the sex aspect completely and just take the animal form, and then you just basically have a lycanthropic ritual without the connection to the cult of Artemis. But it is still within the confines of the invocation.

Now let's talk about the closing of the ritual. Typically, in the best-case scenario, you want a guru who is able to guide the process of the ritual. This individual should be someone who understands rooted consciousness and knows how to place someone in an altered state of consciousness and remove someone from an altered state of consciousness.

If the ritual is going awry and things need to change, then the guru can step in and take someone out of the trance. So that's sort of like a safety measure. The individual who is performing the role of the hunter can do this as well. They can act as a guru who will take someone out of the ritual, who will take someone out of the altered state of consciousness if things are going bad.

And things can go bad. It is very important that you approach this ritual with the utmost caution because lycanthropic states are very, very dangerous. You can hurt yourself, you can hurt somebody else, you can do things that you never would have imagined you could do. You can lose all sense of who you are. You can get trapped in a cycle—you can get trapped in both a mental cycle, you can get trapped in a spiritual cycle, physical, emotional. All of these are possibilities.

So it is important that you are in a stable position before you perform this ritual. If you are not in a stable position in any part of the self—whether it's physical, emotional, mental, spiritual—then you should probably not perform this ritual.

There is a potential for you to wander off from the ritual space during the invocation and find yourself in a lot of danger. So it's very important that if you're going into the wilderness to perform the invocation of Artemis, you do so under some sort of supervision. You need to have a safety net in place in order to make sure that you don't get lost, because there's a potential when you're in a lycanthropic state you might just start running through the woods and then lose your way.

Be very, very careful. Make sure that in the case of working with partners, you inform everyone involved of what the ritual entails in great detail. Don't leave anything to the imagination, because if it's a case where you're working with someone who is totally uninitiated and then all of a sudden these crazy things start happening, that puts them in a very, very bad position.

Always be careful when dealing with lycanthropic states. After all, this is a form of possession—even if it's light possession—and animal spirits are easy to shrug off, it's still possession.

In the process of closing the ritual, the lycanthropic state should just expire itself. The only reason why it would not expire is if you are in a very weakened state before you begin the ritual, in which case you shouldn't be practicing the ritual to begin with.

This invocation is for serious practitioners of yoga only. It should not be fucking around with by people who just want to have a good time and don't really know what the fuck they're doing. It's something that you need to be really careful with.

You can close the ritual through induction of trance and then systematic removal of the lycanthropic state. This is going to be made more difficult if you utilize substances like alcohol, which will root you typically heavier in the lycanthropic state.

But for the most part, the best way to remove someone from the ritual is to establish a strong trance state through meditation and then to place them outside of the body—to bring them to a sattvic state like the vishuddi or the ajna, or to bring them to the sahasra. And then once they are in this state, they can begin to experience the cooling aspect of altered consciousness and eventually they will come out of the lycanthropic state faster.

You can also, if you are in the midst of the ritual and you feel like you want to halt the progression of the lycanthropic state, stop, remove yourself from the ritual space, and begin to bring your awareness to those sattvic states like the vishuddi or the ajna, or bring yourself in awareness with the sahasra. Practice meditation on these states until you are able to clear yourself of the influence of the animal spirit.

You can also perform exorcism—that is a possibility. The specifics of which I won't go into in this lecture.

All right, have fun.
