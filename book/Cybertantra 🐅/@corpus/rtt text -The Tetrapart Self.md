# The Tetrapart Self: A Revolutionary New Approach to the Pyramid of the Self

## Introduction

Written tradition holds that the Pyramid of the Self is divided into three parts. The Tripart Self has been the dominant model for thousands of years. It is found in Aryan tradition throughout the globe. In assessing this tradition, I have always found something to be lacking. It was not until recently that I came to a realization that revolutionizes the way that the Self is perceived in tantric tradition.

## The Problem of the Tripart Self

The Tripart Self within traditional tantra is arranged as a pyramid that includes the elements of body, mind, and spirit. In the Age of Shakti, the body forms the base of the pyramid with spirit acting as the capstone. In the Age of Shiva, the pyramid is reversed, with the body forming the subtle element of the capstone. The arrangement of the pyramid is placed in alignment with the chakras. Traditionally, the three “lower” chakras are presented as chakras of the body, while the three “higher” chakras are presented as chakras of mind and spirit. The lower chakras are of the left-hand, while the higher chakras are of the right. This presents a problem. There is clearly an imbalance in the tripart model, with two elements of the Self resting on the right-hand, and only one element of the Self on the left.

Tantra is a highly balanced tradition. The fact that the Tripart Self presents a glaring imbalance has always seemed anti-traditional to me. For many years I have contemplated this problem, and now I have arrived at a solution. The Tripart Self is the product of a bias towards transcendence in modern tantra. The dominance of right-hand path schools has allowed this bias to remain unchallenged until now.

## The Tetrapart Self

The time has come to restore balance to the Pyramid of the Self. I have decided to reject the Tripart Self and offer a new model of the Self: The Tetrapart Self. The Tetrapart Self elevates the inner-fire (thumos) to the status of a major element. The following ranking describes the new arrangement of the pyramid in the Age of Shakti:

- Capstone: Spirit
- Contemplative Communication: Mind
- Active Communication: Inner-Fire
- Base: Body

The inner-fire was selected as the fourth element for multiple reasons. First, there is an energetic balance that is introduced with the elevation of inner-fire. The contemplative element of the mind lacks an immanent counterpart in the Tripart Self. The inclusion of the inner-fire creates the necessary balance between the right-hand and left-hand. The contemplative aspect of the mind is balanced by the active aspect of the inner-fire.

Second, there is a basis in tradition for the inclusion of inner-fire as a major element of the Self. For example, Plato’s concept of the Tripart Self includes the logos, thumos, and eros. This version of the Tripart Self reveals a bias towards the immanent, with the spirit eliminated as a major element. The Tetrapart Self provides a balanced model that eliminates all bias to either the transcendence or immanent paths.

Third, the introduction of inner-fire provides for the integration of an elemental framework within the Pyramid of the Self that is balanced. This framework is presented as follows:

- **Water**: Spirit
- **Air**: Mind
- **Fire**: Inner-Fire
- **Earth**: Body

Fourth, the Tetrapart Self provides for the integration of the yugic cycle. This framework describes the elements that are dominant in a given yuga:

- **Satya Yuga**: Spirit
- **Treta Yuga**: Mind
- **Dwapara Yuga**: Inner-Fire
- **Kali Yuga**: Body

Fifth, the Tetrapart Self allows for balance in the arrangement of the chakras. The Manipura is rightfully depicted as a communicative point in balance with the Vishuddhi:

- **Spirit**: Sahasrara
- **Connecting Point**: Ajna
- **Mind**: Vishuddhi
- **Balance Point**: Anahata
- **Inner-Fire**: Manipura
- **Connecting Point**: Swadhisthana
- **Body**: Mooladhara

## Conclusion

It is through the Tetrapart Self that balance is reintroduced. Both transcendent and immanent biases have prevented the full expression of the Pyramid of the Self. I have presented the Tetrapart Self as the solution to these biases, and it is within this new model that a revolution in the conception of the Self may be achieved.
