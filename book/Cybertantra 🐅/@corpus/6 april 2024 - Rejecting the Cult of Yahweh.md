### Rejecting the cult of Yahweh
6 april, 1:30 am

**How to get out**
Be ready to get your reputation damaged.

Participation in the systems will poison you, spiritually
- Marriage: legalistic marriage is purely abrahamic. The involvement of the state severs the connection with the gods. A ritual that binds the divine feminine into submission, and places the divine masculine in a degenerated position of false authority. Casting thei own bind on Shakti
	- Bribes: be careful about participating
- Usury and the banking system: another form of binding magic. Force the people into a condition where they are held in bondage to the will of the system
	- Find a way to get out of debt. Use your imagination.
- The political system. Another binding ritual. When you vote you are giving your prana to the church of the political system. Follow an aspect of the Black Sun to see the revitalization of the healthy solar aspect.
- Keep myself out of the media. Remove myself completely. They are practicing yoga nidra. They can put you in a lull.
	- Find rogues for news but wary of controlled opposition
- Don't enter churches
- Don't pay tax. A true leader can garner support voluntarily. Any system supported by taxation is a broken, degenerated system.
- FIAT MONEY. Part of visshutthi magic (yahweh). If you want to manifest, you create a matrix of ideas and convince other people to give power to your idea. Money right now is plain pretend. Not tied to any raw material. As soon as we stop playing pretend, all the power is 
- Play the bare minimum with the system.
- Play hard at freeing yourself.
- To escape the power of Yahweh you have to TOTALLY reject the law. You have no rights. These are playing pretend. There is no good and evil. There is only what is dharmic or adharmic, good or bad for you. Practice civil disobedience as often as you can. In a way that doesn't destroy you. This is key to making change in our current dimension AND in the wider scheme of things. Don't say thank you to the system. Take it and run.

- God comes to people at their lowest moment. When somebody dies, when you are in your darkest hour. Insidious stuff. This is not elevation, it's a new condition of slavery. A true liberator wants to see you live with no chains. To elevate you to the condition of brotherhood of one another.

- Participate in a counterculture. There is strength in numbers. 

The path of Dharma: to realize your nature and express it.
One true way: the True Black Sun. The Black Sun is the usurper, the solar aspect in divine union with the earth mother. The Healthy divine masculine, in alignment with the healthy divine feminine. If you can find that source of unification, that is your key to defeating the magic of Yahweh. 



- Couldn't agree more with any of these points
- In my case I feel I've been kind of doing these things timidly. From escaping taxation in spain to doing the bare minimum within the system while working extremely hard at freeing myself
- But I had never connected these things in a spiritual sense


- And I have to say that until now I had never seen this as an expression of something abrahamic. And the part that hit me the most was the comment on God and its minions coming to people in their darkest hour

I'm too new to all this to even formulate a question but just wanted to comment that this is a powerful message and it really resonates.

It was a very powerful lecture, yesterday. I wanted to bring myself to say something but I was completely floored. I think I needed a good night sleep to put my thoughts in order

I had this weird sensation where I was agreeing with every point of the exposition as it progressed, but at the same time it was challenging a lot of assumptions I had.
I think it was a mix of the simplicity of the delivery, the thinking from first-principles and the power of the message. 
I think I've been very comfortable in my current position for a long time and I haven't heard in a while something that was so articulate and challenged me that hard. It made me rethink a number of things:
- First the message around scaping the system resonates with me, fully. I have been engaged in full sabotage for a long time. I've escaped the tax system almost fully and been experimenting with ways to me mostly off the grid too.
- But this has also led a little bit into isolation. I think I never saw an overarching spiritual drive in it.

- Then, I feel my thoughts about christianity shifting too. I think I've bought into the message that degenerate culture is the driving force behind what's going on, and that we need to return to true christian values. But I've also always felt unsatisfied in my own exploration of christianity.
	I've done catholic retreats and have a couple of priest friends, but my overall sensation is that they are crushed men. It was that exploration and the rejection of it that led me into a quest into finding a "true" meaning in the bible, and exploring stuff like the Elohim, the actual figure of Yahweh as demiurge, Atlantis and a lot other stuff, which ultimately has set me on this path.
	- I can see now how the degeneration of the culture can actually be associated to the degeneration of christianity as a cult, and now the concepts of slave and master morality are starting to make sense to me in a fundamental, radical sense.
	- I don't know too much about jewish or islamic culture first-hand, but I can tell they're also absolutely degenerated, perhaps even more so.
- I am also starting to come around to this concept of the feminine ideal being crushed, absent, in modernity, and I guess now this crazy thing that's going on with transvestite men usurping women's sports is starting to kind of make sense, as is the weak defense of women that weak men are engaging in by hiping up "women's sports", where it's just mens sports played by women.
- The hardest hitter in all the lecture: the point about God coming to people in their darkest hour, and offering nothing more than renewed slavery. I think anyone being truly honest could see this. This is the one that hit for me, there's no escaping this point.
