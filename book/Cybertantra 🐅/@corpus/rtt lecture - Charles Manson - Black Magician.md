well it's going to be recorded so uh this is something we can talk about in the chat a lot too because obviously Manson is a pretty controversial figure so there's a lot of things we can go over but let's begin so Charles Manson was basically a street kid when he was growing up he grew up in really rough conditions and he faced a lot of Trials and tribulations which gave him this intense awareness of the gaps in society he started to recognize all of the areas where there was corruption there was inconsistency and a lack of sustainability and it was this lack of sustainability that really impacted Manson because he saw in American culture this Empire of cards and he knew that at any point in time the whole thing could just collapse because the values that American culture were built upon are the abrahamic values America is a Protestant Nation first and foremost and uh elements like the Protestant work ethic and the uh the Protestant slave morality are ingrained in the culture and those elements are the backbone of the system but Manson saw that things were changing and as he became an adult he recognized that there was was this growing pessimism within the United States and within this growing pessimism he found pockets of positive culture now Manson is associated with the hippie movement in our contemporary culture and when people look back at Manon they they think you know uh he's just a like a long-haired hippie and but the problem with that is that Manson wasn't depicted that way or didn't um express any connection with that culture outside of the mainstream narrative and the way that he was presented to the public through the media in reality Manson was basically a survivalist and he had a lot more in common with the uh Ted kazinski typee um anarcho primitivists that we see today than the uh typical hippies of the 60s but he was slotted in with that movement because basically anyone who expressed ideas outside of the mainstream culture at the time anyone who looked a little strange um and also the fact that he was hanging out in San Francisco and he was into rock and roll music and stuff like that into the Beatles And The Beach Boys um Manson was easy to slot in with the hippies but Manson was operating on a whole another level so Charles Manson was essentially a black magician and his goal with his magic practice was to achieve imminent power he wanted to remove himself from the crumbling system that he had identified specifically he felt that as I said the culture was rotting but also the economic system was falling apart the ecological system was falling apart and race relations were falling apart now the issue of race is very important here because Manson recognized that a great karmic debt had been accumulated by the United States because the Americans had taken Africans away from their Homeland and brought them to America to be put into slavery and so Manson would make comments and he'd say something like you know why would you remove the African man from Africa he was a God in Africa and he's a slave here and so the whole idea was that Manson recognized that different people will thrive in different environments that are in alignment with their nature and he saw that Africans when they were in Africa were allowed to have their gods they were allowed to express their will and they were allowed to achieve the type of freedom and Liberation that he sought for himself but he couldn't find that type of Liberation in the American culture because he did not resonate with the Protestant work ethic he did not resonate with the Protestant slave morality he wanted something more and so he started to accumulate followers Manson was very charismatic um in terms of his rooted Consciousness he was rooted in the anahata and he was a very strong imminent anahata so he had a natural magnetism to him and some anahata types are uh sort of Born to Be leaders and Manson was definitely one of those types so he was able to gain a following quickly and his message resonated very strongly with young people who were becoming disenfranchised with the system they didn't want to have anything to do with the capitalist system and they felt that the United States had become sort of like one giant prison system so Manson offered these people a way out a way to escape the prison system and eventually he moved all of his followers out to a ranch far away from civilization out in the desert and and they were preparing for the collapse of American society they believed that this collapse was inevitable but they also believed that um the faster they could bring about the collapse the better they could position themselves to attain power within our present order now at that time Manson spoke a bit about magic Concepts and Witchcraft to his followers but just a bit it wasn't overt the occulted aspects of his practices did not become evident until much later after he was arrested and was imprisoned so we're going to talk about that in a moment but for now I just want to give kind of a recounting of the uh the Manson killings and the aftermath and what led up to those killings so Manson um was sort of like a Channeler in that he was channeling messages through music um but he wasn't doing it in the traditional channeling sense what he was doing was he was taking messages that he found in music and he was presenting it in a very poetic and esoteric way in order to demonstrate his ideas so uh the strongest example of this is the concept of Helter Skelter Helter Skelter is a song by The Beatles that Manson took and utilized as a platform for expressing his concept of attaining power through a dark age or a collapse of Civilization now if you think about it if you listen to Helter Skelter there's this theme of climbing up to the top of the slide and then dropping down and it's a cyclical process going up the slide and back down now the way that Manson presented this song in its message to his followers was very much indicative of a Yugi cycle he was basically saying that civilizations rise and fall and it's cyclical and it's inevitable and so if you find yourself in the point just before the fall and you're able to position yourself effectively before the fall then you can be a king in the new age and so Manson saw this new Dark Age forming and this was an American Dark Age a fall of the American civilization and so he wanted to be on top and he wanted to create a new order for his followers and he was um very much interested in advancing the will of his followers specifically he had a cult of very dedicated female followers who essentially are a modern manifest of a mayad cult the manads being the Dian women who in ecstasy Rebellion against the solar aspect will go into a lycanthropic state and uh Express their will in honor of dionisis so Manson had that kind of effect on these women they were willing to give themselves to him to his cause because they believed in his cause and they believed that he would offer them the type of Liberation they were so deeply seeking so you know some of these women were like uh upper middle class women who were just really unhappy about being stuck within the system and they were willing to abandon everything and go move out to the desert with Manson and his family uh so that they had a prospect of achieving that kind of Freedom that they were seeking and he really did offer freedom to his followers uh they were for the most part if you if you uh listen to the stories of uh the Manson women who didn't develop some type of um resentment uh or found some Pathway to to uh escaping the shadow of Manson by criticizing him uh his followers remained very dedicated even after his imprisonment and that is because he he stuck to his word in offering them Liberation now Helter Skelter as was presented by Manson was sorry what was that oh never mind never mind um heler Skelter as presented by Manson was a plan for creating a race war in the United States and leading to the destruction of white civilization because Manson believed that white people had become so decadent in the United States and so weak due to their adherence to the uh Protestant system that if he could uh inflame a race war they would be wiped out completely and Manson and his family would hide out during this time now Manson was um not really a white supremacist but he was like uh definitely a racist and he believed that um blacks needed to have some kind of framework some kind of uh structure for them to exist within civilization that he believed that they would not create that framework on their own and they wouldn't be able to operate that framework so his idea was that he was going to hide out with his personal Army essentially and after this race war that would lead to the extermination of whites in America Manson would come out rise to power and he would direct this new this new America if it was a very apocalyptic vision and there's questions as to whether or not Manson was even really serious about this or if he was just applying some chaos magic approach in order to create as much um disruption of the system as possible because the one thing that is certain is that Manson was very very anti-stem and he was very much opposed to the continuation of the American power structure so in order to achieve Helter Skelter Manson and there's obviously continued controversy over this but Manson may or may not have directed certain members of his family to commit murders specifically there is the uh murder of Sharon Tate which I'm sure all of you have heard of and uh this was a very very vicious murder Sharon Tate was pregnant when she was murdered um they the the followers of Manson when they conducted this killing they use the blood of their victims to put messages on the walls of the house that would indicate that this killing was actually uh perpetrated by radical blacks in the area because they believed that once this would be uh seen once this would be shown in the media that it would cause such uh a stir that it would kick off the race war that would lead to elter Skelter now um it's important to understand that at this time in American history there this type of grizzly attack wasn't common and nowadays people are murdered all the time in this country and uh it's just something the American people have gotten used to but at that time it was really incredibly shocking and so with this murder um there was basically a death of the hippie movement a death of the uh optimism within the counterculture because Manson was after he was arrested and tried and uh convicted for this he was used by the system as a means of undermining any type of culture activity and making the hippie movement look like something really dangerous and really scary and of course there was no race war so Manson's plan did not come to fruition but that wasn't the end for Manson because Manson continued his activities while he was in prison now most people are quite aware of everything that Manson was involved in prior to his attempt to bring about Helter Skelter uh what most people are not aware of is all of the really deep occult activity that Manson involved himself in after this time period while he was in prison first it's important to note that Manson had some pretty strange um Communications while he was in prison with different figures and involvement with different organizations specifically Manson was sort of like a proxy Guru to James Mason James Mason the famous white supremacist founded the universal order which was a satanic occult Neo National Socialist organization that took its name and symbol from Charles Manson because James M was in contact with Charles Manson and Manson gave him the idea for the name of the organization his symbol and gave him some instruction on how he should proceed with his organization now the universal order is not something that Manson was heavily involved in he did name the organization and he gave a little bit of direction to Mason but there's a question as to whether whether or not Manson was just using James Mason for fun and I think he was I think that uh Charles Manson was not really serious about his interactions with Jame Mas James Mason he thought okay this is just a guy that I can use to create more chaos because ultimately that's what Charles Manson was all about Manson is a shadow figure he was a black magician in the purest sense in that he sought to Rebel against the solar order and he was willing to do that uh by any means necessary because Manson was a non-dist he existed Beyond Good and Evil uh this is from a letter that Charles Manson wrote to Marilyn Manson in the letter Charles Manson said it's a far out balance Beyond good and bad right wrong and this is a concept that's very important to understand when you're talking about Charles Manson because this is something he always comes back to it's the idea that there is no such thing as good or evil Charles Manson exists Beyond Good and Evil and because of that he's able to do something like you know allegedly order the killing of Sharon Tate and her unborn child if he knows that it is serving The Wider purpose of realizing his Dharma or some dharmic expression that is uh of a social significance of a of of a transformation of the social order so um Manson was very very interested in this idea of non-duality and creating balance between the dark and the light and this is interesting considering that he was rooted in the anahata which is the point of balance between the Divine masculine and the divine feminine now his interest in this aspect of ult practice creating balance culminated in his integration of the dity abraxis abraxis is an ancient deity that is depicted with serpent legs and a rooster head and uh abraxis is associated with balance he is a non-dualistic figure so the idea behind a brais is that when you integrate the serpent aspect of his legs which is shaki with the rooster or bird or Eagle these are all figures associated with sahasra the crown when you integrate that Shiva aspect with the shaki aspect you achieve Transcendence Transcendence Beyond Duality a realization of non-duality and to exist Beyond Good and Evil so you'll remember from my talk about n n was also very interested in this concept of achieving some balance between the light and the dark and then transcending good and evil so in in a way you can say that Manson is a very nian figure so Manson went as far as to to um take on the name abraxis he released an album where he referred to himself as abais and he promoted the worship of abraxis there are abraxis Cults now which formed out of a combination of the influence of Charles Manson and Anton Le because the Church of Satan spawn many uh Splinter organizations and one of these organizations was the Temple of set which uh members of the temple set would later go on to promote abais worship and a former member of the Church of Satan Boyd rice a very prominent member a man who was actually in line to take over the Church of Satan before Anton L died he is a very prominent supporter of Charles Manson and a proponent of abraxis worship so the abraxis cult is very strong now especially within satanic currents and it is deeply oriented towards the idea of achieving balance now what do they mean by balance well we exist in a solar culture and within that solar culture the abrahamic system reigned Supreme so the idea of abraxis worship is that you're trying to achieve balance between the light and the dark and you do so through the application of a counterbalance so if you're existing in an abrahamic system what is the counterbalance well it is Lucifer and so we see in Charles Manson's song that he dedicated to abraxis a lot of really interesting occult ideas so I'm going to go uh section by section through this song and discuss what Charles Manson is touching upon in terms of the esoteric significance of his of his music and of his ideas in general in the first line he says oh Lucifer my light your heart's been pierced and it bleeds in my night so he's immediately invoking Lucifer Lucifer being the counterbalance to Yahweh he's saying that Lucifer is his Guiding Light the heart of Lucifer has been pierced so this the heart represents the will and so Lucifer's will was attacked by Yahweh he was placed in this restrictive element Manson resonates with this because he himself felt great restriction within the abrahamic system he resonated with Lucifer because Lucifer represents that struggle that will to express one's power and drive towards Liberation within this prison system that's why he says that it bleeds in his night so he understands the uh pain that Lucifer feels then he says Lucifer rise in my mind see all in splendor Perfection on the Wind he's asking Lucifer to rise to the point of contemplation so Lucifer is an active figure he's an imminent figure but he's trying to integrate Lucifer into all aspects of the self and when he can do that when he says see all in splendor he's saying that his integration of the luciferian aspect is giving him the ability to see every aspect of Consciousness and understand everything that is occurring within his surroundings so that he can act appropriately that is the Perfection on the Wind he goes on to say down in the fires at night in my mountain man keep on Brave coming from the grave so this is discussing some aspects of his willingness to take action to separate himself from the wider culture and this is a brave act because it takes a lot of gut to uh Place yourself against such a powerful system um to come from the grave is to uh go down the descending path and Rise Again with power which is what he's achieving oh Children Of Darkness Shadows on the wall I keep seeing you so this is Manson's recognition that there are others who are walking this path this is a left-and path movement that he is forming and imminent movement expression of the will expression of the ego and so he sees that there are other children of darkness and he's trying to reach out to them this is his attempt to expand the influence widen in the family in the nights of what I see that you could be within the days oh my darling in the days of another dream so this is the fact that Manson is showing an optimism in the destruction that occurs through the application of the counterbalance there is a potential for a new order to rise this is the days of another dream this is his willingness to always remain dedicated to the application of his will in the attainment of a new dharmic order a new luciferian order so the luciferian aspect of Manson is also integrated in his name Manson emphasized the son of man concept man son son of man he would often compare himself to Jesus Christ but Manson did this in a way to where he could represent himself as a shadow aspect of Christ so he recognized Christ acting in Rebellion but in a solar aspect whereas he acts in rebellion in a lunar aspect he turns the entire thing on its head and he becomes sort of like a demonic uh methus type figure and this is interesting because Christ is associated with the anahata uh mephistophilis the anahata braxus the anahata Manson The anahata all of this it's very heart-c centered very much about applying counterbalance creating a new order through through this counterbalance and just as one final uh note here that I want to mention before we get to questions I think it's interesting to consider Marilyn Manson Marilyn Manson was very interested charl excuse me Charles Manson of course because he named himself after Charles Manson and Marilyn Monroe but if you think about uh Charles Manson as compared to Marilyn Manson Marilyn Manson is like a spana Charles Manson he's really basing his entire artistic approach upon the occult practices of Charles Manson because Charles Manson was trying to show the dichotomy between things in order to create a new world so if you think about the name Marilyn Manson it's a dichotomy it's Marilyn Monroe this beautiful figure that everybody loves and then Charles Manson This sort of like ugly Sinister figure but they both are surrounded by violence they're both surrounded by the decadence of American culture they're both surrounded by the rotting system now Marilyn Monroe was consumed by it but Manson was not Manson was never consumed consumed by the system he may have been in prison but he was liberated and he remained liberated until the end of his life and that is the sign of a very very powerful magician okay any questions or comments ride the tiger yoga offers
