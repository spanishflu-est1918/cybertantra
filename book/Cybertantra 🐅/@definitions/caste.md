# Caste System

A system of social organization based on natural inclinations and dharma (true nature), not to be confused with the later corrupted hereditary system.

## Traditional Categories
- Brahmin (philosophers/teachers)
- Kshatriya (warriors/leaders)
- Vaishya (merchants/creators)
- Shudra (workers/craftsmen)

## True Principles
- Based on individual nature (dharma)
- Determined by qualities not birth
- Fluid and merit-based
- Serves societal harmony

## Modern Context
- Often misunderstood as rigid birth-based system
- Original system based on natural abilities
- Potential for authentic social organization
- Contrast with democratic uniformity
