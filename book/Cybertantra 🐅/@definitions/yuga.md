# Yuga

A cosmic age or cycle in Hindu cosmology. There are four main Yugas that repeat in a cyclical pattern:

1. **Satya Yuga**: Age of truth and direct spiritual awareness
2. **Treta Yuga**: Age of mind and intellect
3. **Dvapara Yuga**: Age of passion and cultural achievement
4. **Kali Yuga**: Age of matter and physical form (current age)

## Characteristics
- Each Yuga represents a different state of consciousness
- Progressive descent from unity to multiplicity
- Movement from spiritual to material focus
- Current age (Kali Yuga) represents the most materially-focused period
