## The Rise of the Mental Age

As the gods withdrew, space was cleared of their presence. And into this vacuum rushed the mind, a fundamental transformation in consciousness, that happened across centuries.

This is the age of the Vishuddhi, the throat chakra. To clear misconceptions, the mind's center is not in the brain. The brain is merely an organ, part of the blood body. The mind is something else entirely—a force that, like air itself, invades every space it can find.

The mind itself is not our enemy—look at what humanity has achieved in this age: we've conquered the skies through aviation, spread our voice through radio waves, and extended our reach into space itself. The computer you're reading this on, the vast network connecting minds across the globe, these are expressions of the Vishuddhi's highest potential.

But we live in the end-stage of this age, where the mind has become decadent, corrupted by Abrahamic frameworks that demand submission rather than mastery. And here lies our unique challenge: we exist simultaneously in the Kali Yuga, where blood and flesh form consciousness's foundation, and in the declining Vishuddhi age, where everything must be filtered through the decaying mind.

The mind is voracious. Like a great white shark, its mouth is always open, one giant throat, consuming. By its very nature, it turns physical reality into concepts, abstractions, dead things it can analyze. The very word "analysis" comes from the Greek ana-lysis, meaning "to cut through, to loosen, divide, cut apart".

As the age of the mind rises, humanity trades direct experience for understanding. Knowledge and wisdom are confused, and old gods that have been quietly lying dormant for centuries, waiting for the right moment to emerge, are now thriving in the new world.

But the degenerated mind is a prison. Its corrupted nature is to kill to understand, to reduce everything to abstract concepts devoid of life and power.

We've built the most sophisticated prison in history—a cage made not of iron bars but of thought-loops and concepts. At least a physical prison is honest about what it is. This mental prison pretends to be liberation, pretends to have knowledge of itself. But the corrupted Vishuddhi is also the place of deception, the place of illusion and imagination.`

## The Intellectual Wheelchair

In the age of the Vishuddhi, much of the thinking is done for us. TV, the news, and all forms of legacy media that's still being produced today is designed specifically to do your thinking for you. And as we mentioned when we talked about the Yugas, the acceleration of all things is the nature of the present moment. Just in the past few years, you can see the work of the artisans of propaganda in the way language is forcibly changed to fit the system of control. For example, they're grooming the masses to demand censorship by forcing the concepts of "misinformation," "disinformation," and "fake news" down their throats. They changed "immigrant" and "emigrant" to "refugee," "asylum seeker," and "migrant." "Mostly peaceful protests" are used to minimize violence and the destruction of property. "Sustainable" and "green" have been co-opted from their original meanings into marketing buzzwords that often mask environmentally destructive practices. "Carbon footprint" was popularized by oil companies to shift responsibility from corporate polluters to individuals. "Peaceful protesters" and "domestic terrorists" are applied selectively based on political alignment rather than actual behavior. "Content" replaces art, music, writing, and film - reducing creative works to mere consumable products. "Equity" has replaced "equality" - shifting from equal treatment to enforced equal outcomes. "Diversity" now means conformity to specific ideological views rather than the true variety of thought and background.

This is no accident. This is Vishuddhi magic in its most degenerate form—mind control through language control. The corrupted priesthood of Yahweh continues its ancient work of separating humanity from the direct experience of power.

And so on and so forth. This is simply Vishuddhi magic, in its most degenerate form —mind control. There's a war going on for the narrative, control of the mind of the masses and the individual.

In the past, art was extremely challenging. Great productions of Greek tragedy, classic novels, and works of art challenged the people. The media presented them with something to chew on. There was an encouraging aspect to it. The artist, the writer, opened the door and invited us to experience the mind, but we had to bring something in return. As we get deeper into modernity, people are spoon-fed ideas instead. Film, television, novels, the stage- all designed to be as immediately perceptible as possible. When we interact with this media, all we really have to do is show up and then absorb whatever is being given to us.

And because of this, the mind is handicapped. We are born into an intellectual wheelchair.

// TODO: talk about the war for cyberspace by the end

Now, imagine what that would do to the physical body if you were to be born and immediately placed into a wheelchair. Your body would atrophy, it would wither away and you would be physically weak. Your body would have no reason to develop muscles, to develop a healthy skeletal structure.

Because the body is the aspect of the self that is most readily perceived in the present age, as soon as you experience this atrophy, you would know it and it would be obvious to everyone. It would be totally insane. Everyone would know immediately if we started putting babies in wheelchairs as soon as they were born and not giving them the chance to crawl, to learn to walk, to learn to run, to learn to jump and climb and advance. If we denied humanity this aspect of the self, everyone would shout from the rooftops, oh, this is insane, we shouldn't do this, right?

But this is exactly what we do to the mind in modernity.

As soon as you are born, you are told exactly what to think. You are read books that tell you what to think. You are placed in an institutional learning facility where you are taught exactly what to think and how to think it. You go to college, same thing. Or maybe you don't go to college, but it doesn't matter because everyone around you is going to tell you exactly what you need to think, and the wider culture is going to try to shove ideas down your throat. Furthermore, they don't need to tell you; you will absorb it from thin air, in mental osmosis, drawing from the collective unconscious.

Ideas are cheap now. Very few people have confidence in the quality of their ideas in the current age, so these individuals who present you with an idea have to brainwash you. They cannot present a poignant thought in a few words or a short presentation; they have to write a 900-page book about it.

Very rarely will you be presented with an idea by a confident thinker who is willing to honestly present you with such an idea and say to you, "Take it or leave it." And those ideas, those raw ideas that are really meaningful, are challenging and difficult for people to engage with. This is why the concept of the "marketplace of ideas" is nothing but a meme. Challenging ideas do not survive through the masses; only the loudest thought wins.

The Shudra, the intellectual lower caste, the NPC, they want something easy to digest. They want to be brainwashed. They desire programming. They actively seek it. Academia has suffered a complete takeover from the Shudra and the ones who want to feed the Shudra. This is why you see so many of these learned scholars who live for the 2000-page magnum opus from the latest obscure Marxist "thinker." It allows them to undergo the process of willful programming. And because they were placed in an intellectual wheelchair when they were born, it feels good to them to have everything injected, manipulated, and twisted into their mind. Because to interact with a difficult idea would require standing up from that intellectual wheelchair. And most people aren't willing to feel their legs shake, feel their bones quake, and feel the ground fall out from underneath them.

So, until the Liberation of Cyberspace, radical ideas became increasingly difficult to find in the culture because people were not interested in exploring them.

Until very recently, people who presented these radical ideas were actively discouraged from doing so. Some were cancelled, de-platformed, debunked, destroyed, or even killed. Some simply lacked the courage to pursue them. And so these ideas go unspoken.

Within the initiation of the Right Hand Path, yogins step out of the intellectual wheelchair. They stand up, and they take command over their mind. They hone it, and they establish autonomy and authority within it. They say, no longer will I will I allow you to spoon-feed me information. I am going to willfully engage with scary ideas and challenging ideas. I'm going to place my mind in conditions where I can test its strength, grow, and flex my head.

This is what we do on the Right-Hand path at the stage of the Vishuddhi. And it is a revolutionary idea within the current age. Because the system does not want you to think. The system does not want you to flex your head. It wants you to remain in your intellectual wheelchair. The second you take control over your mind, that's the moment when you start to entertain those ideas that become a threat to the system. That's when a personal revolution comes to a new level of self-realization, that is, contemplative realization.

This is no metaphor. This is the true story of how modern consciousness is crippled from birth.

Individuals are born into a state of unrefined Shakti. In this state, you're pure reaction, pure compulsion. When compelled, you will take action. When horny, you will masturbate. When sad, you will drink and sulk. When angry, you will lash out. This is what living in a state of unrefined Shakti means—to be a puppet of your impulses, dancing on strings you can't even see.

They want you focused on your body—but through the lens of consumption and shame, never power and beauty. They want you to think about race contantly—but only in ways that generate guilt and confusion, never pride and strength. They want you to be active, unrefined, immanent in your expression, but only within the narrow channels they've created. They want you to be physically weak, emotionally dead, and spiritually bankrupt.

One-pointedness becomes your prison. You're forced into this state by society because if you're a cog in the machine, placed in your spot, doing one task over and over again, being in a state of passive observation is bad for business. It might make you start asking questions: "Why does that Coca-Cola commercial make me horny? What are they doing to my brain? Why did my doctor give me this pill and tell me I need to take it every day to feel happy? Why do I need a pill to be happy? My ancestors didn't need a fucking pill to be happy."

If you start breaking free from this—which you will if you practice real meditation, real yoga—people will react in three ways:

1. They'll become jealous of you
2. They'll feel like they no longer have control over you
3. They'll feel pressure to be better themselves

They don't want to be better. They want to remain in their comfortable cage. They want you back in your wheelchair because your standing up reminds them they're still sitting down.

This is why blood consciousness—understanding your heritage, connecting with ancestral gods, and feeling the power of your lineage—is considered so dangerous. In the Kali Yuga, authentic connection to blood consciousness is revolutionary. It's the key to genuine power, which is exactly why it must be suppressed.

The very intensity of this suppression reveals how powerful blood consciousness truly is in our age. They wouldn't work so hard to disconnect us from it if it wasn't the source of real power. The entire structure of modernity is designed to suppress the natural creative fire that burns in the blood.

But there is another way. We can escape this state. We want self-control, and we cannot have that until we bring Shakti into our power. When we allow Shakti to dictate how we behave, we are in a state of **compulsion**. Only through control of compulsion and indulgence, can we escape, but not only that. The mind is the ultimate prison, but it can be forged into the most powerful weapon of all.

## The Mind as a Prison

When we operate from the Vishuddhi, we build a system for understanding the world around us. And this system needs to be solid. Just like you need strong bones to stand up straight, you need a strong mental framework or you'll get lost in the tornado of thoughts that's endlessly swirling around in consciousness. This mental framework itself is the mind.

There is nothing more disorienting than rejecting the framework that's been built for you and trying to build your own. Without a framework, you'd be lost, so the space between the rejection of the old and the building of the new is a space of confusion, an uncanny valley of fear and uncertainty, where maladjustments in the Vishuddhi become obvious.

The concept of maladjustment is very important because each chakra we explore in Kundalini Yoga has the potential to bring us power or to undermine it. We willingly cross that door to understand what is present within each state of consciousness.

Within the framework of modern psychology, these maladjustments are seen as mental illnesses and have to be dealt with accordingly. It is a dangerous path to be on, and it is one that requires a lot of self-control. Navigating the mind, especially, is like navigating a minefield. Asceticism and a healthy foundation in the body are extremely important requirements for success.

The mind is the only aspect of consciousness that is entirely internalized. Where the Manipura expresses outward—it's all about that fire, that expression, the mind turns inward. There is a tendency to internalize, to become isolated. You can see this tendency within modernity. It occurs to anyone who has an overstimulated mind. This is something that is often associated with autism. Individuals become increasingly introspective, and the outside world becomes intolerable. And so if you are severed from your gut and you're existing within the mental space, you can manifest these symptoms of radical introspection. That's where solipsism begins to develop. In mild cases, you might just begin to think that your ideas are the only ideas that matter and you create this intellectual arrogance. The new atheist movement is full of this kind of maladjustment in the Vishuddhi, where people like Sam Harris believe they have the answers to all things, and they live to tell you that what they see is the way the universe works. And there's just no arguing with it.

And from there, it's a short step to the ultimate prison: "I'm the only thing that really exists." That's when you enter truly dangerous territory. That's when the existential crisis hits—that nauseating feeling that permeates modernity where you can't trust a fucking thing, not even your own senses. The radical skepticism sets in. This is what leads to mass atheism. It's not that these people have actually thought deeply about the divine—they've just decided they're too smart to believe in anything they can't dissect with their minds. They think they're being rational, but really they're just trapped in the smallest possible box of understanding. Like a blind man declaring that color is a mass delusion, they've mistaken their inability to perceive for proof of non-existence.

These people develop such intellectual arrogance that they'd never even consider something like magic. You are going to learn about some radical things in this book, the kind of things that we involve ourselves in this school: summoning entities, direct spiritual experience, attempting things that would be considered miracles. Imagine telling them about it, about anything that exists outside their mental framework. They would sneer. "Oh, that's ridiculous. Those people are in a cult. They're brainwashed. They're fucking nuts." Of course, they say this—because they've never experienced anything outside the mind. They can't. They won't allow themselves to.

You can spot these people everywhere now. They don't value spiritual experience because it can't be measured. They don't value emotions because feelings get in the way of "pure reason." They don't value the body because physical reality is "just an illusion." So they don't exercise. They don't move. They don't engage. They just sit there, consuming, thinking, and theorizing while their bodies shrivel up and their spirits die.

Look at them—these walking examples of the diseased mind. Cold and dead inside, physical pieces of shit on the outside. They're everywhere now, these people who've made the mind their god. And here's the ultimate joke: just because they operate from the mind doesn't mean they're smart. That doesn't mean they're wise. There's a world of difference between intellect and wisdom, and most of these "highly intellectual" people wouldn't know wisdom if it bit them in their atrophied ass.

Here's the real food for thought: those people you see mindlessly wandering through Walmart are highly intellectual people. By "highly intellectual," I mean they exist almost entirely in the mental space. They spend their days consuming and processing information—through their phones, TV, and social media. Hour after hour, day after day, they just take in mental content.

This is the dark irony of our age: stupid people are actually trapped in pure intellectualism. They live entirely in their heads. The body becomes just a vehicle for the mind. Emotions are inconvenient interruptions to be medicated away. Spirit is reduced to an occasional Sunday visit to church, but it is never really engaged with the way yogins do.

Think about it: these people consume more information in a day than a medieval scholar would see in a year. They're constantly processing news, entertainment, and advertisements - an endless stream of mental content. Their whole existence is intellectual consumption. But because they never learned to use the mind as a tool, it uses them instead.

This is why we need to break this fundamental misconception: these people aren't anti-intellectual - they're the product of pure intellectualism divorced from body, emotion, and spirit. They're what happens when you live entirely in the mind but never learn to master it.

Because here's what's so funny about all of this: people who are rooted in the Vishuddhi are supposed to be the natural warriors of a culture. The mind isn't meant to be a prison—it's meant to be a weapon.

## The Mind as a Weapon

The Vishuddhi is the place of Chivalry, of Knighthood, of Bushido, of the Samurai. It is the place of the law, the word, the order that is upheld by the sword. The sword is the weapon of the Vishuddhi, and the most beautiful aspect to it. It is the tool of the warrior. It cuts through the bullshit and establishes grounding in the mind. With the sword you make your point, and with the sword you stand by it.

And working in this state, you create the armor you will wear to navigate the world. This is part of your mind matrix. And it is all of the great technology that we find in modernity. An aspect that can become self destructive when not properly integrated with the other elements of the self.

This is why the greatest warriors throughout history were also scholars. The Samurai practiced calligraphy with the same dedication they brought to swordplay. The knights of Europe were expected to be as versed in poetry as they were in combat. The warrior-scholars of ancient India could debate philosophy as skillfully as they could wield their weapons.

We exist within a world where the intellectual and the warrior are seen as opposites. Where being "smart" means being physically weak, and being strong means being mentally dull. A total crippling of both paths. The intellectuals become weak, timid creatures, while the warriors become thoughtless brutes. Neither reaches their true potential because they have been cut off from their complementary aspect.

The modern "intellectual" seeks out surrogate activities to replace the warrior spirit they've lost. Video games become a substitute for real adventure. Online debates replace real confrontation. Virtual achievements stand in for actual victories. They need these substitutes because they still carry the warrior archetype within them—it's part of the Vishuddhi nature—but they've lost all connection to its real expression.

This school is one such counterculture that upholds the healthy expression of the mind, represented by the knight, the samurai. An aspect of the mind that we will see reborn on this earth or we will die trying.

The mind must be trained like a sword—sharp, precise, capable of cutting through deception to reveal truth. The intellect must be forged like armor—strong, flexible, and able to protect what's valuable while allowing movement and growth.

This means rejecting the false dichotomy between physical and mental development. It means understanding that true intellectual strength requires the same discipline, the same courage, and the same warrior spirit as martial training.

This is the path of the warrior-scholar, the true expression of the Vishuddhi nature. A path that demands everything from us—physical discipline, mental rigor, spiritual courage. But it's also the path that can lead us out of the mental prison of modernity, that can transform the mind from a cage into a weapon, from a source of weakness into a source of power.

Our enemy is not the Vishuddhi itself - we celebrate its highest expressions. Look at flight - both physical through aviation and digital through radio waves and the internet. Look at our technological achievements - the computer systems that extend human capability, the conquest of space, the entire infrastructure of modern communication. These are the gifts of the Vishuddhi when properly expressed.

No, our enemy is the degenerated mind - the mind that has forgotten its proper role as a tool for directing and focusing power, not a cage for containing it. Our enemy is the mind that has been twisted by Abrahamic frameworks into an instrument of oppression rather than liberation.

Here at the end of the Vishuddhi age, we're reclaiming these airways, these technologies, these tools of mind. We're transforming them back into what they were meant to be - instruments for expanding consciousness and power, not limiting it. The sky belongs to us again. The mind belongs to us again. And this time, we're not letting go.

## The Deterministic Flow of Ages

There's a crucial distinction between civilizational autonomy and civilizational determinism. Certain cosmic flows are deterministic - like the changing of seasons, the progression of yugas, or the shifting of consciousness through different ages. Just as we can't stop winter from coming, we can't prevent consciousness from moving from the Vishuddhi to the Ajna age.

This deterministic aspect exists because the masses aren't integrated into yogic practice that would allow for breaking these cycles. Most people remain subject to these changing seasons, to the advancement of civilizational consciousness. However, while we can't change the fact that consciousness is shifting from Vishuddhi to Ajna, we do have autonomy in shaping how that shift manifests.

If we align ourselves with free expression, with a dharmic meritocracy based on art and beauty, with the conquest of space and beyond, then we can shape the spiritual prana of the Ajna age to benefit this vision. But our enemies have a different idea - they want a global Stalinist communism where we have no freedom of expression, where we're all slaves to the state, living in constant paranoia and fear.

This is why, as autonomous individuals practicing yoga, it's our duty to take action to ensure we shape the future, not our enemies. If they gain control, we face a thousand years of space communism. If we succeed, we establish a thousand years of the Nietzschean caste system on a global scale and beyond. This is what we're fighting for right now, and while we can't stop the age from changing, we absolutely can determine how it manifests.
