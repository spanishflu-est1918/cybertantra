There is a fire that burns in the gut of every living being. Not a metaphorical fire - a real force of energy. You can feel it right now if you pay attention. That burning sensation deep in your belly that rises when you're filled with rage, or love, or the unstoppable urge to create something that's never existed before. This is no poetic flourish - this is the raw, daemonic force that makes you alive rather than just existing.

The Inner Fire is the daemonic force of passion and creativity, rooted in the blood and breath, a central element for the cultivation of power in both individual and collective consciousness. In Tantra, we consider it the manifestation of the primal energy of Shakti —the divine feminine force– within the Self.

The ancients knew this fire intimately. The traditional connection between the Inner Fire and the divine feminine is found in a variety of cultural manifestations. They had different names for it,  but they were all pointing to the same primal force, the active principle itself, the spark that turns thought into action, potential into reality.

Tummo refers to the Tibetan goddess of heat and passion. But also to a specific for of tantric meditation that is directed towards accessing the Inner Fire. The goddess Tummo is a manifestation of Shakti, and the Tibetan tantric practices associated with her are very similar to those found in the Indian tantric tradition. These practices are rooted in a shared Aryan tradition that has given birth to many similar traditions throughout the world.

In the Greek tradition, the Inner Fire is represented by the concept of thumos (θυμός), a word that means spiritedness. It is a concept that is directly related to the breath and the blood, two elements that are central to the practice of tummo and the physical manifestation of Shakti. In tummo, breathing exercises are employed to harness the power of the Inner Fire. These practices fall under the tantric category of pranayama. The Greeks believed in an explicit connection between the breath and the spirit, a connection that is rooted in the Aryan concept of pranayama and the flow of prana through the body.

The blood, a symbol of passion, is central to the shared traditions of tummo, thumos, and pranayama. The blood is the seat of passion, and the association between blood and Shakti is clearly represented in the tantric tradition, especially in the manifestation of Kali. The symbolic connection between blood and the Inner Fire emphasizes the daemonic nature of this force, and the material orientation of Shakti as energy.

The Inner Fire as daemonic power is emphasized in the Platonic concept of the soul. In The Republic, Plato presents a tripartite soul that is similar to the tri-part Self of tantra. The Platonic tripartite soul consists of the nous (intellect), thumos (passion), and epithumia (appetite). These soul elements correspond to the chakras, with nous representing the higher chakras (name?), thumos representing the middle chakras (Rajas), and epithumia representing the lower chakras (Tamas). Thumos and epithumia are of a daemonic nature because they are rooted in lust and passion. According to Plato, thumos and epithumia may be brought under the power of the will in the form of nous in order to maximize power. This is the Greek method of cultivating the Inner Fire. By gaining control of the daemons, the yogi is able to achieve unification and the expansion of power to the highest potential.

In the Norse tradition, Odin assumes the role of the yogic figure to be emulated by those seeking liberation. It is no surprise then that Odin is associated with the breath. Odin’s association with the breath is keeping with the theme of Odinistic Yoga, the Norse practices which parallel the tantric traditions found in the Indian and Tibetan traditions.

Inner Fire cultivation is firmly rooted in the natural experience of the Norse. The harsh cold of Scandinavia required the development of an inner resolve that allowed for survival. By cultivating the Inner Flame, the Norse were able to more effectively adapt to their environment. There is a close physical connection between Northern Europeans and the cultivation of Inner Fire.

From a physical standpoint, cold exposure plays an important role in the harnessing of Shakti power, and such techniques tend to come naturally to those of Northern European descent. It may be considered that through the process of natural selection, the Northern Europeans possess the greatest potential for integrating the Inner Flame into the social body. This is a potential explanation for the prevalence of the Path of Action in Northern European tradition, with Valhalla providing an excellent example of cosmic immanence and the Left-Hand Path.

In the tantric tradition, the Inner Fire is closely tied to the **Manipura chakra**, the seat of expression, personal power and transformation. Practices such as **Bhastrika pranayama**, cold exposure, and the consumption of rajasic foods (aphrodisiacs, spicy food, citrus fruits) are employed to stoke this fire, ensuring its continuous burning. However, fire is of a wild and unpredictable nature. The key to balance lies in integrating the Vishuddhi (the mind, air element) to regulate the flame, ensuring it stays in proper balance. The air of the Vishuddhi feeds the flames of the Manipura; too much air can stifle the flame, and not enough can lead to self-consumption.

Thus, the Inner Fire, whether expressed as tummo, thumos, or Manipura’s energy, is a universal force that bridges the physical and spiritual realms. It is that which drives the warrior's charge into battle, an artist to pour their soul onto canvas andthe lover to risk everything for passion It is the daemonic power of passion, the creative spark of Shakti, and the driving force behind action and transformation. Its cultivation requires discipline, balance, and a deep connection to the natural and divine forces that sustain it.


## Aryanism and the Expression of the Manipura

Aryanism is a civilizational manifestation of Inner Fire. At its core, it is rooted in the Manipura chakra - the seat of expression, personal power, and transformation. When we speak about Aryanism in its traditional sense, we're speaking of access to this fire - the "Aryan spirit" that can be accessed by any living being that possesses awareness.

This Inner Fire is what distinguishes Aryanism from other traditions. It is inherently creative, active, and transformative. Born in the belly, the womb of creation, this fire is the rising sun within us, and it requires material to create from and manifests as the will to act, the will to create, to transform. It is the spark that turns potential into reality.

Contrary to what many political keyboard warriors of the modern world would have you believe (*alternative: contrary to the common misconception, if avoiding direct attacks*), Aryanism is not limited to any specific race, ethnicity, or political movement precisely because this fire burns in all living beings. It is a fire cult that emphasizes active creation and affirmation of life. It is inherently a Shakta tradition, meaning it recognizes and embraces the divine feminine -Shakti- as the foundation of existence. The Aryan path is about cultivating this fire, directing it, mastering it - not in service of some abstract intellectual ideal but in service of expanding power and manifesting will. It involves a constant cycle of renewal.

In stark contrast, Abrahamism - encompassing Judaism, Christianity, and Islam - flows from the Vishuddhi chakra, the seat of mind and intellect. Whereas Aryanism embraces the fire of creation and the chaos of transformation, Abrahamism seeks to impose order through intellectual frameworks and moral absolutes. This is reflected in their fundamental approaches: Aryanism demands mastery, whereas Abrahamism demands submission.

The Abrahamic traditions represent what we might call "father cults." They are directed toward the "divine father." They emphasize transcendence over immanence, mind over body, and spirit over matter. Yahweh's obscuring of his appearance is telling—he does not communicate with human beings in this dimension of consciousness with the same intention as deities in the Aryan tradition. Whereas Aryan deities show themselves openly, inviting direct experience of their presence, the Abrahamic deity remains hidden, demanding faith in abstract principles.

*This conflict manifests in practical ways throughout society. The Abrahamic emphasis on sin and moral absolutes stands in direct opposition to the Aryan recognition of power as the true measure of value. Abrahamic institutions systematically work to suppress the natural creative fire - from educational systems that force stillness and one-pointed focus, to religious frameworks that label natural impulses as sinful. The Abrahamic framework actively undermines individual reasoning ability and natural creative power to create perfect slaves for their god. They achieve this through sophisticated mechanisms of control: moral systems that induce guilt about natural impulses, educational systems that reward conformity over creativity, and religious frameworks that promise salvation through submission rather than liberation through mastery.*

The result of this rivalry is the greatest war of our times, waged on the battlefield of human consciousness—one that underlies all other forms of cultural and physical conflict. A war born out of the fundamental incompatibility between these traditions, each seeking total triumph over the other. Yahweh represents the Tyrannical Patriarch, while Aryanism embodies rebellion against this decadent patriarchal order through alliance with the mother principle.

This war manifests both esoterically and materially. It represents a cosmic battle between the forces of mind and body, intellect and creative fire, where each views the other as an existential threat to its values and vision of the world. In our contemporary culture, this plays out in the increasing abstraction and intellectualization of life, the suppression of natural impulses, and the systematic devaluation of direct experience in favor of abstract knowledge.

Our work in this Age is to wage war against the forces of oppression in favor of liberation.

However, the need for liberation is born out of a fundamental imbalance - the dominance of Abrahamic intellectualization over Aryan fire - that must be addressed. This war isn't simply about the victory of one side over the other. The path forward requires understanding that, in cosmic terms, both the fire of creation and the power of the intellect have their place. This war is about restoring proper balance. When the fire is stifled, life itself diminishes. When intellect becomes unmoored from the creative fire, it becomes sterile and life-denying.

This is the essence of tantric practice: the integration of all aspects of consciousness in service of expanding power. It recognizes that true power comes not from submission to abstract principles but from mastery of all aspects of being - both the fire of creation and the discriminative power of intellect. The war being waged is ultimately about whether humanity will choose the path of submission or the path of mastery.
