      <h1>CYBER TANTRA</h1>
      <h2>The New Frontier</h2>
      <h3>THE SPARK WITHIN</h3>
      <p>Tummo. The goddess of heat. Her flame rises through the spine. The Tibetans knew this. The Greeks knew this as thumos. We who practice know the fire is one fire.</p>
      <p>The Inner Fire is Shakti herself, coiled and waiting. She is the spiritedness that drives action, the radiant power that demands expression. Blood is passion. The seat of fire. Kali drinks it.</p>
      <p>Soma is said to reside in the heavens. And it is said in the Aryan mythology that Soma is brought down by an eagle, brought to the people, brought to the gods by an eagle who risks his life to bring that beautiful drink to us.</p>
