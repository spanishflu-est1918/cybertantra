# Chapter 7: The Right Hand Path

## The Nature of the Ascent

The Right Hand Path is not a lifestyle. It is a method for achieving a very specific goal. That goal being ego death, mastery of the self. If you continue on the Right Hand Path indefinitely, it means that you have failed. The goal is to reach a specific point, the point of transcendence. Once you reach transcendence, you achieve ego death.

Kundalini is the movement of Shakti from the base of the body up to Shiva at the crown.

Put simply, the Right Hand Path is the process of unifying the self by exploring each state of consciousness and bringing Shakti into unification with Shiva. There is a lot of confusion regarding the nature of the Right Hand Path versus the Left Hand Path. The Right Hand Path is not the state of being in a love and light new age hug-the-world mentality. That is a major degeneration from the original tradition.

## The Mountain

We climb the mountain. That is what we do in this school. All of these things belong on the mountain, the mountain that is beyond the horizon. And the horizon, what does it represent? It represents the limits of our perception. If we can break beyond the limitations of our perception, those limitations that we are born with, those limitations that are grounded in the blood, that are grounded in Shakti---if we can break through that, we can find that holy mountain and climb it.

We each possess our own dharma. The path up the mountain differs for each seeker. Part of the process of yoga is exploring what is your dharma. How do you access it? How do these various elements of consciousness, as represented by the chakras, interact with one another in order to create a unique individual?

There are many paths up the mountain. There are many paths that lead to these various checkpoints. Your guru should be able to identify what you need on an individual level in order to advance through all of the potential maladjustments at each state of consciousness.

## Compulsion and Indulgence

Ultimately, the Right Hand Path is all about removing compulsion so that when we reach the Left Hand Path, we can engage with indulgence. There is a big difference between those two.

Compulsion means you do not have a choice. They give you a cookie and you fucking eat it. Indulgence means they give you the cookie and you say, hmm, do I want this? Yeah, I do want this. I take it and I eat it and I enjoy it. Because I have a choice. I am not just reacting. I am not just a wild animal. I have regained my humanity. I am able to express my will. That is what we want.

Most people do not possess the ability to express their will in this manner. They exist almost entirely in a state of reactivity. Being born of the earth, there is a tendency to want to consume. This is an aspect of the Muladhara---the consumptive aspect, the mindless consumptive aspect. Without a point of contrast, compulsive activity becomes dull---yet the compulsion continues regardless of satisfaction.

If they are not an indulgence, if they are a compulsion, they can undermine my power. You could become addicted to the Internet. You can become internalized in this way. You find the compulsion and you apply the necessary yogic method to address that compulsion.

## The Unrefined Shakti

The ego is poisonous because we are all born into a state of unrefined Shakti. Shakti, the divine feminine force, is the foundation of all experience, all creation. From the perspective of the Yuga cycle, we exist within the master age of Shakti. Within both the Dvapara Yuga and the Kali Yuga, we exist as embodied beings.

What does it mean to be embodied? We are speaking specifically of the physical self, the physical manifestation of the body, which is the foundation of all experience. Within the Kali Yuga, it is the platform of consciousness. The pyramid of the self is structured like this: at the foundation the body, the physical body, the blood. Then inner fire, passion, creativity, the cosmic womb. Next the mind, introspection, imagination, contemplation. And at the capstone of the pyramid, spirit, the subtle body, that which unifies, that which gives access to shared experience.

When we allow Shakti to dictate the way that we behave, we are in a state of compulsion. We cannot have self control until we bring Shakti under our power. We cannot be at the control of Shakti. We cannot allow her to dictate the way that we behave.

## The Process of Refinement

There is the natural expression of sexuality, which in its unrefined state is compulsive, and there is the spiritual or subtle expression of sexuality. The yogic path provides methods to overcome compulsion, to advance from the unrefined natural state.

The Right Hand Path requires dealing with all of our attachments, all of our compulsions, in each element of the self. In body. In inner fire. In mind. In spirit. And everything in between. We have to assess each state of consciousness. We have to expand our awareness---that is the Tantric element. We are expanding our awareness of these states. We are coming into full realization of the self.

You cannot deny the self. You cannot reject the self. You cannot kill the ego unless you know what it contains. And once you know what it contains, you can kill it. And once you have killed it, then you have released yourself from compulsion. You have released yourself from that which is destructive in Shakti, the unrefined Shakti. You have gone through a process of refinement.

## Maladjustments

There is potential for each chakra to bring us power or to undermine our power. In order to understand what is present within each state of consciousness, we have to enter into those states. We can enter into the state of consciousness such as the Muladhara and we can see what is in there.

What is keeping us grounded? What is keeping us from moving forward? What about this state of consciousness is leading us to compulsion? What is bringing us to a state of attachment? What is keeping us from advancing towards ego death?

It is very important, if you are going to be in an independent practice, to be very honest with yourself, to determine whether or not you truly have eliminated those maladjustments. If you move forward prematurely, you will have to go back and address those compulsions that are holding you down and keeping you from reaching transcendence.

## The Muladhara: Greed

The Muladhara is directly related to security. It is related to all of your primitive needs, your primitive desires. Shelter. Food. Sex. Security. All of these things are aspects of the Muladhara in a primitive sense.

Ultimately, every maladjustment, every single one that manifests within the Muladhara, can be traced back to that one essential poison of greed. If you possess this awareness that the maladjustments in anger, consumptive behavior, sadness, confusion---whatever maladjustment may occur---all of these things are related somehow to greed. If you know this, you can begin to work through all of these maladjustments.

Once you have achieved that, once you have overcome these maladjustments and you can exist peacefully, you can exist in a state of meditation within the Muladhara. That is when you know that you have gained body awareness and you are ready to move on. Advance up the mountain and enter into the Svadhisthana.

## The Svadhisthana: Envy

The Svadhisthana is refinement. It is the root of differentiation within consciousness. When we begin to recognize the difference between black and white, the difference between hot and cold, bland and spicy. It is still a Tamas state of consciousness. There is an earthiness about it. But there is also this element of fire. The Svadhisthana rests between the Muladhara and the Manipura. The element of fire that is mixed with the earth creates magma. Magma is the elemental designation of the Svadhisthana.

Individuals who are rooted in the Svadhisthana tend to be the most sensuous of people. They navigate the world through the material and the sensations they experience through interaction with the material. They are sensing the material like a snake that slithers on the earth and sticks out its tongue and tastes the environment.

The Svadhisthana is associated with the sin of envy. Every maladjustment that can be traced back to the sin of envy. Body dysmorphia. Hyper-focus on those elements of the material that are perceived to be negative. Nitpicking the shit out of yourself and your environment. Dead set on identifying everything, every little thing that could be wrong with that form.

How do you break from these rigid standards that we apply to ourselves in maladjusted Svadhisthana? First you have to recognize your Dharma. You have to sense whether or not you are pursuing your nature. Attachment is always a barrier to expressing your dharma. If you have an attachment to a specific idea, you have got to destroy it.

## The Manipura: Wrath

The Manipura is the state of consciousness that is, for most people, the hardest to navigate within modernity. Modernity is synonymous with the age of the Vishuddhi. The Vishuddhi, according to rooted consciousness, is the adversarial state to the Manipura. At the foundation of the Manipura: inner fire, creativity, expression, passion, emotion. On the opposite side, at the Vishuddhi: introspection, intellect, mind, air, coolness.

Everyone who is born rooted in the Manipura is by their very nature adversarial to the prevailing age. These individuals are natural social outcasts more so than any other expression of consciousness. The Manipura in the present age, in modernity, is unacceptable socially. Expressions of the Manipura are discouraged. Expressions of the adversarial aspect of the Vishuddhi are encouraged.

The individuals who are rooted in the Manipura that I have met in my life actually operate from the Vishuddhi because very early on in life, they are viciously bullied into their minds by society. They are expected by their parents, by their churches, by their schools, by their institutional learning facilities to conform to the mind, being in the mind, existing in that space.

When you practice Kundalini on the Right Hand Path and you are advancing into the Manipura, what you are doing is making space for your emotional expression. You must view your creative passion as a yogic pursuit. You have to throw yourself into creative activity consistently. This type of activity is just as important as your daily asana practice. It is just as important as your daily meditative exercises or your pranayama practice.

You have got to ignite that flame and keep it.

## The Anahata: Pride of Will

The Anahata is the place of will. The will and identity. Ultimately, we exist because we will ourselves into existence. Without application of will, we would cease to be. Our very existence is reliant upon our application of will, our will to power.

The Anahata has no adversarial state except for itself. Everyone who is rooted in the Anahata experiences this intense struggle with the self. It is more like a dial. The elemental nature of the Anahata is electricity. With this dial, you are determining how much electricity are you putting out, how much are you taking in. Are you going to reduce yourself to a very small flow or cut off the flow of electricity altogether, or are you going to turn it up to eleven and just throw lightning bolts.

The secret to mastering the Anahata is to never take half measures. You must express purity. You must choose just the right amount of electricity and apply it without hesitation. If it does not come from the heart, if the heart is not allowed to be expressed to its fullest extent, it will fail.

Never give up one centimeter of territory in your heart. Because the second that you do that, you are turning your back on who you are fundamentally.

## Toward the Contemplative States

As you advance up the pyramid of the self, it becomes more difficult to recognize that aspect while you are in an unrefined state. You can reach a point where you can access and recognize with equal awareness every element of the self. But that requires yoga and that requires Kundalini and the Right Hand Path.

The Ajna is the point of abstraction just before you reach the Sahasra, where you achieve unification. The Sahasra, for those operating in the Right Hand Path, is the final station. The goal is a clear light experience, transcendence, ego death.

---

## The Living Death

As you get higher up your spine and you advance through the chakras, you reach the condition of purity. Pure water. Absolute silence. Death.

It is a living death. That is what we are searching for on the Right Hand Path. And that condition of purity requires a rejection of the self.

Ego death is the point where you experience detachment from the physical experience entirely and you have a profound moment of unification with all things. When you are practicing with the intention toward ego death, the Kundalini energy naturally tends to continue rising. The ultimate goal at the Sahasra is to have a clear light experience---to reach transcendence.

---

## The Paradox of Transcendence

The cosmos has two grand potentialities. Either everything is unified at the monistic point, or you exist in differentiation. Because time is not linear, we exist in an eternal cosmos that can be perceived as cyclical, but the cyclical nature is itself illusion and it can be escaped. The perception that you apply in assessing the nature of the cosmos is an aspect of will, expression of will.

You are advancing between that which is unified and that which is differentiated. And you are smashing the two potentialities together at once. You are saying: I am denying my will to continue to exist in a differentiated form. But simultaneously, the anchor that is present within your heart will not allow you to dissolve fully.

For some people, the anchor is not strong enough, and they do dissolve. There are people who have performed Kundalini and reached the Sahasra and have died immediately as a result of the practice because their will to exist faltered and they did not want to continue. They were dissolved into the clear light.

But if the necessary anchor is present---in whatever form it may take---the passion that is expressed burns through with total irrationality, burns through the paradox of unification and differentiation existing simultaneously. That is when you transcend everything. You transcend duality. You transcend non-duality. You transcend all.

---

## Rebirth

From this point of transcendence, you can taste dissolution. You can taste differentiation. And you can indulge in one aspect or the other. You can choose to be dissolved. Or you can choose to be differentiated. This is reincarnation. When you have achieved this reincarnation, you are able to exist with indulgence rather than compulsion as your foundation.

The Left Hand Path begins when you are reborn. At this point of rebirth, this is when you choose to be dissolved into oneness or to become a self realized individual. Ego death is the prerequisite. The baptism in the sun must be completed before the Left Hand Path can truly begin.

## The Promise

Know that if you reach the peak of the mountain, no matter what is on the other side, it is worth pursuing. Because ultimately it is you. Whether your dharma is to unify with God or to become an individuated being fully realized---it is you, it is what you were meant to be. And so it is worth pursuing.

Once you have completed the Right Hand Path and you reach this point of transcendence, you have made it. That is when many, many new paths are open to you.

The Right Hand Path is not a lifestyle. It is a mission. When you come to that final stage of the mountain, when you realize your potential for transcendence---whatever that may be, it is dharmic, it is related to your nature, how far you can go---there is no right answer other than that which is natural to you, that which is dharmic to you.

When you reach that point, you have made it.

And the flame burning strong---your total expression, your line in the cosmic symphony---is going to want to experience the full thing. Everything that you have to offer.

Bear that torch in the darkness.

Run with it.

Hold it.
