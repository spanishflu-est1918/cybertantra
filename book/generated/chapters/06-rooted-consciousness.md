# Chapter 6: Rooted Consciousness

## The Revolutionary Discovery

The general approach that we take within this school is unique in the fact that this is the only school which utilizes rooted consciousness. I developed rooted consciousness. So as it stands, if you want to explore Kundalini utilizing this system, this school is the only option now. I hope that changes in the future because I want rooted consciousness to be utilized by everyone. It is a revolutionary idea and it is a powerful system and it can bring about a lot of good in the world.

This discovery came through years of practice and absorbing the dogma from Right Hand Path schools. I was informed by my upbringing in the Left Hand Path. I realized that the way they were portraying consciousness was totally wrong.

---

## The Lie of Unlocking

I started to realize also that the idea of unlocking chakras, unblocking them, is utter bullshit. Because I realized that these chakras relate to elements within the self. This is something I had to discover on my own because the tradition had been lost, obscured for thousands of years.

I realized that, okay, I possess a mind. I possessed a mind before I began the kundalini process. So I don't need to unblock the Vishuddhi in order to have a mind. I already have a mind. I don't need to unblock the Muladhara in order to have a blood body, a racial body, a physical body. I already have that.

You don't have to open any chakra to have access to all of these elements of consciousness which exist within you simultaneously.

So these aren't things that you gain over time through the process of kundalini. What you gain through the process is understanding awareness of that which exists within you.

All of these states of consciousness, they are within you at all times. The reason we practice Kundalini is not to open or unlock these chakras. It is to inhabit them.

## The Pyramid of the Self

The way that the body works, the manner in which we experience the self and everything that surrounds the self, is entirely dependent upon the structure of the pyramid within a given age. We exist in the Kali Yuga. So the body, the blood, is the foundation. And this has a major influence on the way that we perceive reality.

The pyramid of the self is structured like this in our present age. We have at the foundation the body, the physical body, the blood. Then we have inner fire, passion, creativity, the cosmic womb. Next we have the mind, introspection, imagination, contemplation, the foundation of contemplation. And then we have, at the capstone of the pyramid, spirit, the subtle body, that which unifies, that which gives us access to shared experience.

Because the body is the foundation, everything that is physical, everything that is a gross expression or a natural expression, is immediately perceptible. It is easy to recognize flesh and blood. It is easy to recognize a floor when you are standing on a support. It is easy to recognize a wall when you place your hand against it and you can lean into it. It is easy to recognize a rock.

As you advance up the pyramid of the self, it becomes more difficult to recognize that aspect while you are in an unrefined state.

---

## The Subtlety of Higher Elements

You have inner fire, the next step up. That includes the emotional element of the self. And emotions, they are something that you can see in other people. It is something that you can feel very deeply. There is a physical component to emotions. They impact the way that your body operates. When you are sad, you may cry. When you are happy, you may laugh or smile. There is this intense physical component, but it is not so cut and dry as flesh and blood. So things are becoming a bit more subtle at that point.

Then you have the mind. Now, the mind is far more subtle than pure emotion. Because the mind is something you cannot see in another person. It is totally internal. And so the mind can operate in communication with emotion, in communication with flesh and blood. But it is very hard to capture and hold. You cannot touch it, because it is of a subtle nature. It is an aspect of the self that is related to the contemplative chakras which are associated with Shiva. And we are in the master age of shakti. So those chakras that are associated with the active state or shakti are the immediately perceptible chakras.

After that, we have the spirit. Now, the spirit is the most subtle point. It is the Sahasrara within our body. You find it at the crown. And so this is associated with the subtle body. This is where you have connection to those things that most people in our present age would probably reject or apply some skepticism towards. Even religious people who make claims that they believe in some higher power, they hold reservations regarding the nature of the spirit because it is so experiential and it is so difficult to access.

And since we operate from a foundation of that which is physical, it makes sense that most people, lacking a direct experience of the concentrated aspect of consciousness in the contemplative chakras, would look upon the spirit and everything that is accessed through the spirit with great skepticism.

I have said in the past that in the Kali Yuga, God is like a whisper on the wind. That which exists beyond the immediate state of consciousness, the immediate dimension of consciousness, is very, very difficult to perceive. You have to work very hard to access that point.

## The Tetrapart Self

Written tradition holds that the Pyramid of the Self is divided into three parts. The Tripart Self has been the dominant model for thousands of years. It is found in Aryan tradition throughout the globe. In assessing this tradition, I have always found something to be lacking.

The Tripart Self within traditional Tantra is arranged as a pyramid that includes the elements of body, mind, and spirit. The lower chakras are of the left-hand, while the higher chakras are of the right. This presents a problem. There is clearly an imbalance in the tripart model, with two elements of the Self resting on the right-hand, and only one element of the Self on the left.

Tantra is a highly balanced tradition. The fact that the Tripart Self presents a glaring imbalance has always seemed anti-traditional to me. The Tripart Self is the product of a bias towards transcendence in modern Tantra. The dominance of right-hand path schools has allowed this bias to remain unchallenged until now.

The time has come to restore balance to the Pyramid of the Self. I have decided to reject the Tripart Self and offer a new model of the Self: The Tetrapart Self. The Tetrapart Self elevates the inner-fire, the thumos, to the status of a major element:

- Capstone: Spirit
- Contemplative Communication: Mind
- Active Communication: Inner-Fire
- Base: Body

The inner-fire completes the pyramid. Without it, the mind hangs unbalanced, lacking its immanent counterpart.

Second, there is a basis in tradition for the inclusion of inner-fire as a major element of the Self. For example, Plato's concept of the Tripart Self includes the logos, thumos, and eros. This version of the Tripart Self reveals a bias towards the immanent, with the spirit eliminated as a major element. The Tetrapart Self provides a balanced model that eliminates all bias to either the transcendence or immanent paths.

It is through the Tetrapart Self that balance is reintroduced. Both transcendent and immanent biases have prevented the full expression of the Pyramid of the Self.

---

## The Bias of Transcendence

Within the Right Hand Path yoga that is presented by most modern yoga schools, there is a bias towards transcendence. The chakras are represented in the Right Hand Path as a hierarchical system with a clear superiority of the Sahasrara, the Crown chakra. Now this implies that the root is inferior, the crown is superior.

Those schools that have a bias towards transcendence are going to apply this really ridiculous, petty morality that has nothing to do with the tradition of Tantra. The way they were portraying consciousness was totally wrong.

Because if you are trying to escape duality and reach transcendence, you have to recognize that each state of consciousness must possess equal value. It is ridiculous to assign this qualitative hierarchy that is absolutely true, universal for all people.

Rooted consciousness does not rank the chakras in terms of their energetic superiority. No one chakra is inherently superior or inferior to another. They simply represent different energetic states.

---

## Everyone is Born Rooted

Everyone is born with a type of consciousness, consciousness that corresponds to one of the seven chakras. The consciousness that an individual is born with is referred to as the rooted consciousness or rooted state. This is a home consciousness that is represented by a chakra.

This rooted state colors all experience. If you are born with a rooted consciousness in the Muladhara and then you shift to the Manipura, you are going to be acting predominantly from the Manipura, but it is going to be colored by your rooted state in the Muladhara. The Muladhara expression of the Manipura is distinct from how a Manipura-rooted person experiences their own state.

Each rooted state exists on a spectrum with an adversarial state. The Manipura and Vishuddhi exist in opposition. The Ajna and Svadhisthana exist in opposition. Though the adversarial states on the spectrum are in opposition, they do share certain similarities. Through yogic practices it is possible to effectively integrate one's adversarial state.

---

## The Spectrum of Fire and Air

So you have as the foundation of the Manipura the inner fire, creativity, expression, passion, emotion. And then on the opposite side, at the Vishuddhi, you have introspection, intellect, mind, air, coolness.

If you think about the alchemical nature of the Manipura, we have fire, and in the Vishuddhi we have air. Now, these things can complement one another because you need to have oxygen, you need to have air fed into the flame to build a fire. Fire feeds off of the air, and air needs fire in order to be brought down to earth, in order to fuel expression.

But of course, if you have too much air, you will put out the flame. And if you do not have enough air, then the fire cannot burn. So there needs to be some sort of balance between the inner fire in the belly and the intellect in the mind in the throat.

The Manipura is expressive and the Vishuddhi is introspective. The introspective nature of the Vishuddhi is really interesting because it is the only aspect of consciousness that is entirely internalized.

The Manipura is expressive in nature and it is very materially oriented. Being on the left hand, there is a desire to express one's will within the material world. And this impulsiveness is counter to the Vishuddhi, which is very introspective. And there is this desire to remain in contemplation, in meditation, which also can become impulsive.

---

## The Difference Between Intellectual and Experiential

There is a big difference between being introduced to a chakra through the mind, through the intellect, and actually experiencing it in the self, in every aspect of the self, in the body, in the mind and in the spirit. Because when you are able to do this through yoga, through unification, you gain a full insight into the aspects of that consciousness in other people as well as yourself.

For most people, if you examine, for example, a text on the Muladhara or the Manipura or the Svadhisthana, you are going to read about certain traits that are associated with that specific state of consciousness. And while it is helpful to examine these specific traits, there is a deeper meaning to be accessed in actually experiencing the energetic expression.

For example, with the Vishuddhi, you can read about how the Vishuddhi is a state of the mind, of the intellect. And within the expression of the intellect, there are certain behavioral traits that are associated with the mind. And those might include someone who reads a lot or someone who is very introspective, is not a very social person. And so if somebody possesses those individual personality traits, you might assume that they are rooted in the Vishuddhi or they are representing Vishuddhi consciousness. But this is not necessarily so, because these personality traits that manifest can also manifest in other states of consciousness. But the way in which they manifest is different. It is altered. It is specific to the energetic expression of that chakra.

When someone in the Muladhara expresses anger, there is a grounding element to the anger. There is an earthiness to the anger. When someone in the Muladhara expresses sexuality, once again, there is a grounded aspect to it. There is a deep connection to the earth, the soil, the mother, the blood in this expression.

Now, someone in the Vishuddhi can also express anger. They can be a very angry person, but their anger comes from a different place. It is airy, it is cool. There is a pointedness to it.

And the only way that you can really understand the energetic expression of these things is if you experience them firsthand. And that is why it is so important to enter into altered states of consciousness in a kundalini practice.

## Consciousness Analysis

Rooted consciousness may be identified through the process of consciousness analysis. Through consciousness analysis, it is possible to identify an individual's rooted state and determine whether or not any maladjustment has occurred.

The rooted chakra is identified through a series of questions that reveal the specific nature of the individual. Once the rooted consciousness is identified through analysis, specific practices can be prescribed in order to maximize the powerful aspects of that chakra and minimize those aspects that undermine the will and reduce the power of the individual.

Consciousness Analysis is the most powerful system of assessing the realities of the cosmos. Consciousness Analysis assesses the energetic nature of all things. Not just humans. Social bodies. Art. Non-human animals. The cosmos itself.

When I initiate a new student into Vyaghra Yoga, I utilize Consciousness Analysis in order to identify their rooted consciousness. And from there, I craft a program that emphasizes their strengths.

Those who suffer in the mind, who have been labeled broken by the priests of psychiatry, find in this system that they were never broken. They were maladjusted. Consciousness placed in the wrong vessel.

---

## The Problem of Maladjustments

You can have maladjustments in any chakra, regardless of where your rooted consciousness resides. These maladjustments deeply impact your overall expression of consciousness and total being.

There is potential for each chakra to bring us power or to undermine our power. And so we have to, in order to understand what is present within each state of consciousness, we have to enter into those states.

Fixing these maladjustments is not a matter of opening that specific state of consciousness, because, as I said, it is already present. What you want to do is you want to shift to that state of consciousness and then work through the maladjustments that are present.

The most effective method for removing any sort of maladjustment is to go directly to that state of consciousness, whether you are moving to the Vishuddhi or the Manipura or the Sahasrara or any of the other chakras. Going directly to that place and then working through whatever issue is present.

We identify in the Muladhara, what is it, what is keeping us grounded, what is keeping us from moving forward. And then we utilize yogic practices in order to address those problems, in order to address those maladjustments. And once we have done that, once we have completely adjusted that state of consciousness and we have cleared out all the clutter and we know that state of consciousness, then we advance to the next state.

Once you have overcome these maladjustments and you can exist peacefully, you can exist in a state of meditation within the Muladhara. That is when you know that you have gained body awareness and you are ready to move on.

## The Shift Mudra

The process of shifting consciousness requires specific techniques. We utilize methods based upon Yoga Nidra that allow for rootedness in a specific chakra. You can utilize a meditative technique in order to shift your consciousness to, let us say, the Manipura or the Anahata or the Svadhisthana. And in doing so, you can experience what it is like to exist from that rooted state, basically seeing the world through another person's eyes.

I took Satyananda's method and I expanded upon it. And I utilized my understanding of the nature of consciousness and the chakras in order to develop new methods in Yoga Nidra. This type of meditative work has not been conducted in written history until now. This is an advancement in Yoga Nidra.

You are attaching that shift in condition to your body. What this does is it builds a bridge between the blood body and the mind, as well as the spirit. And as a result of this, you are able to feel the shifting conditions of the mind and spirit within the body. This creates a more holistic approach to your yoga.

Until Vyaghra Yoga was developed, there was no way to access rooted states with intention.

## The Manipura in Modernity

Any individual who is rooted in the Manipura is adversarial by their nature to the prevailing age. And therefore it is very difficult for Manipura people to exist in their rooted state without being considered problematic. There is a tendency for society to try to force individuals who are rooted in the Manipura into their adversarial state.

Most of the individuals who are rooted in the Manipura that I have met in my life actually operate from the Vishuddhi because very early on in life, they are viciously bullied into their minds by society. They are expected by their parents, by their churches, by their schools, by their institutional learning facilities, to conform to the mind, being in the mind, existing in that space.

Now, this is very detrimental for people in the Manipura because existing on a spectrum with the Vishuddhi, it is easy for them to slide into that space. Part of the yogic process is integrating that adversarial state. It is sort of like the first major poison that you face in the yogic training. You have to learn how to operate with your adversarial state.

People in the Manipura need to learn to be okay with their introspective element, because these are naturally expressive people. But that is hard to do when your rooted state of fire and emotional expression is not recognized as socially legitimate. So you cannot even begin to develop a healthy relationship with yourself before you explore the opposite side of your consciousness.

And so what happens is these individuals who are rooted in the Manipura get trapped in the Vishuddhi and they begin to identify with the Vishuddhi because it is the only way they can achieve any sort of social integration.

## Entering Altered States

For my students that I have in direct private instruction, I place them in an altered state of consciousness, and then I give them a series of exercises that they utilize in order to explore that state of consciousness and identify what about this state of consciousness is leading them to compulsion, what is bringing them to a state of attachment, what is keeping them from advancing towards ego death.

In order to prepare the body for Kundalini, for the Right Hand Path, this requires entering into a state of consciousness where you are firm enough in your awareness, where you are stable enough to be able to safely advance.

The means by which we reach that point of stability vary greatly depending upon the individual. And if anybody tells you that Kundalini or the Right Hand Path is straightforward and you can utilize this one method, and everyone can utilize this one method in order to achieve transcendence, they are bullshitting you.

Because we each possess our own dharma, our individuated nature. And part of the process of yoga is exploring what is your dharma. How do you access it? How do these various elements of consciousness, as represented by the chakras, interact with one another in order to create a unique individual?

---

## The Purpose of Rooted Consciousness

Do not think this system produces monks. Do not imagine all who walk this path emerge looking the same.

With this path of self realization, you can be anything. The Left Hand Path in its representation within the cosmos is as varied as there are people in the world. You can walk the Left Hand Path and appear gentle as a lamb. You can walk the Right Hand Path and be a monster.

Once you know the self, you can kill the ego. And once you have killed it, then you have released yourself from compulsion. You have released yourself from that which is destructive in unrefined Shakti. You have gone through a process of refinement.

Through rooted consciousness, you come to know your dharma. Through knowing your dharma, you see the rooted nature of others. Through seeing their nature, you understand why they act as they do. The war within ends because you cease fighting what is.

---

## The Foundation Must Be Solid

If you are going to develop your consciousness, if you are going to expand beyond the base expression of consciousness within the present age, you have to have a solid foundation. If you do not have a solid foundation for the pyramid of the Self, everything will crumble to the ground.

And that is why all of these yoga schools, all of these esoteric schools that emphasize theory and reading and meditating all day long are totally full of fucking shit. Because if you do this, if you sit and read Evola and Guenon and all of these jackasses all day long, all you are ever going to get is overstimulation of the mind. You will never establish the firm foundation that you need in the body in order to advance to the higher states.

So it is very important, very important that any guru who teaches yoga focuses on the body and experience. Hatha Yoga as the foundation. And if you are going to practice kundalini, it has to be done by first establishing awareness of the body. And this body awareness is the first step in achieving mastery of the self.

---

## The Spine as Pillar

It is said in Tantra that the spine is the pillar of the universe. It is the center of the cosmos.

Why would we define the spine as the center of the universe or the cosmos or anything? Because the nervous system runs down the spine, spreads out through your body. And it is through the nervous system that in this present age, you are able to explore the cosmos.

If not for the spine, if not for the nervous system, you would have no means of assessing the nature of anything. Anything in your immediate environment, anything in the solar system, anything in the entire universe, in the entire cosmos, could not be assessed without that physical foundation.

And that is why there is such a strong emphasis on the physical health of the spine in yoga, because you are preserving the pillar of the cosmos by preserving the health of the spine.

Next time you practice your asanas, think of that. Think of the fact that your bridge to experiencing all of the beauty within the cosmos exists within your body. It is the spine. And when you practice asana, you are in communion with the very core of existence.

---

## What Has Always Been Yours

The conclusion is simple: you have never lacked these states of consciousness. You have possessed a mind, a body, inner fire, and spirit since the moment of your birth. The Muladhara did not need unlocking for you to have a blood body. The Vishuddhi did not need opening for you to possess a mind.

What was lacking was awareness. What was lacking was the ability to shift between these states with intention. What was lacking was a framework that did not impose a false hierarchy upon your very nature.

The innovation of rooted consciousness is the recognition that the doors were never locked. You were simply never shown how to walk through them. The tradition was lost, obscured for thousands of years. And now it is restored.

You can, through meditative techniques, access altered states of consciousness and experience the world through the eyes of another person. You can start to understand how these elements play a role in your own development, in your own expression of consciousness. Not because you have gained something new, but because you have finally recognized what was always present within you.

The improvement of the health of the spine leads to passive development of meditation. Because when your spine is healthy, when you have taken action to interact with the spine, you have purified the nervous system, you have purified the pathways of understanding. And through this purification, you now enjoy the benefits of existing at a heightened level of awareness.

Because awareness of the body is not just awareness of the blood. It is awareness of everything. As above, so below. That which is within is without.
