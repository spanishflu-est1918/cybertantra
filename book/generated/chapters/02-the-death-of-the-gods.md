# Chapter 2: The Death of the Gods

## The Age of the Vishuddhi

We have existed, humanity has existed, within the age of the Vishuddhi for thousands of years now. This age is defined by an emphasis on mind. And we have seen since the beginning of the age of the Vishuddhi, a grand expression of the power of the intellect. We have seen technological development far beyond what our ancestors would have considered to be possible, because we have emphasized so strongly that flow of the mind.

But the age of the Vishuddhi is modernity. And modernity has a very clear, energetic signature that has been present for much longer than what most historians would identify. Most historians would say modernity begins after the Renaissance. This is wrong. Modernity is synonymous with the age of the Vishuddhi. And that age began with the rise of Judaism.

Specifically, the Mosaic covenant marks a major turning point where Yahwism becomes explicitly socio-political with the promise of the nation of Israel. Yahweh and Judaism are of a Vishuddhi nature. We can see the covenant with Moses as the foundation of modernity, because all of the major aspects of the modern age were born from this covenant. Almost every major sociological aspect of global politics from the moment of this covenant on have something to do with Israel as a metaphysical idea.

This urge to rebel against modernity that you find with thinkers like Julius Evola, Miguel Serrano, Savitri Devi, this really is an urge to rebel against Judaism. To rebel against the metaphysical Israel—the promise that bound a people to a usurper god.

## The Usurper on the Throne

Within the ancient traditions, the patriarchal God in the Jewish pantheon was El. El is very similar to Cronus or Ymir or Saturn. And there's great confusion regarding the nature of Yahweh. Many people believe that Yahweh is Saturn or Cronus, but he is not. He is Zeus.

Yahweh was once part of a polytheistic tradition, and he was a patriarch within the pantheon. You could draw a very close connection between Yahweh and Jupiter of the Roman tradition. There was a primordial father being within the Jewish tradition known as El. These primordial fathers are found in many Aryan traditions: Ymir in the Germanic tradition, Cronus in the Greek tradition, Brahma in the Indian tradition. These are primordial beings. They represent monism, the monistic point. Yahweh is the son of El.

When the Jews were enslaved in Babylon, Yahweh, the cult of Yahweh, was presented to the Jewish people as a path towards Liberation. Liberation from slavery. if the Jewish people could give all of their energy to Yahweh and elevate Yahweh to the position of the one and true God, then they would be liberated. They would be made the chosen ones. And a prophecy would form that would grant the Jews the position of Master of this realm.

With the elevation of Yahweh to the leading position within the Jewish tradition, where he is the one and true God, and the polytheistic faith now becomes a monotheistic faith, a very interesting occurrence happens. Yahweh takes on the name of El. now when you hear El in the Jewish tradition, but also in Western magic, often times when this name is invoked it is bringing in the power of Yahweh. It is not referring to the old primordial God. El was usurped. The idea now is that Yahweh is associated with the primordial Oneness.

The figure of Christ within this Yahwism, within this Abrahamic system, is itself a solar image. Christ is the sun, Christ is Apollo. He is the shining figure, the good son of God who does his bidding. His son, Christ, Apollo, is just an agent of this solar cult. He mystifies. He draws you into the magical circle and binds you in the clear light.

## The Absurdity of the Lawgiver

Consider the god who judges. Consider any god who looks upon the cosmos and declares: this is right, this is wrong, and I have the final say. That god has taken an action.

Praxiology teaches us that no intelligent being takes action unless there is unfulfilled desire. If all desires are fulfilled, there is no need for action. The god who passes judgment, who applies a standard of objective morality to all things within the cosmos, has revealed himself to be incomplete. He possesses unfulfilled desire. He is not omnipotent. He is not the primordial oneness from which authority could legitimately flow.

Any aspect of primordial oneness that engages in interaction must also exist with the opposing force of differentiation. But a god who passes judgment is taking an action, and therefore that god has shown itself to be something other than what it claims to be. The entire system of dualistic morality depends upon the lawgiver. The authority of the lawgiver depends upon his status as an essential being. If that status collapses, the entire edifice of good and evil falls with it.

This is the praxiological argument against dualistic morality. The absurdity of objective good and evil, as represented within the Abrahamic tradition, can be demonstrated through pure logic. The judging god refutes himself by the act of judging.

## The Natural Cycle Arrested

In all Aryan traditions, the story follows the same pattern. A king rises. He becomes the new sky father. He reigns well for a time. Then he grows decadent. Then comes a usurper, and the cycle continues.

In the Germanic tradition, Odin conquered Ymir. He guided the carving of the primordial giant's body into the material cosmos. He reigned. But in the myths, Loki rises against Odin. Ragnarok comes. Mass destruction, then rebirth. New gods rise.

In the Arthurian tales, Arthur is usurped by Mordred. A Ragnarok event. Death, then renewal.

This endless cycle defines the Aryan traditions. A king rises, becomes decadent, falls to a usurper. On and on through the tradition.

There is one way for the sky father to prevent the loss of his throne: elevate himself to the point of monotheistic worship. Absorb all competitors into himself. Declare himself the only god. This is what Yahweh achieved.

Yet even this did not stop the cycle. Even though Yahweh reached the point of monotheism, a new usurper rose out of that tradition. Perhaps the most powerful usurper in any tradition. Lucifer rises to face Yahweh. Satan, properly understood, is not a being but a condition. The Sanskrit roots Sat and Tan combine to form Satan: the condition of becoming god. Any individual on a path toward self-realization exists within the condition of Satan. This is not evil. This is the affirmation of life, the will to power, the pursuit of one's dharma to its fullest expression.

## The Monotheistic Mind Virus

The concept of Good and Evil is not a part of the Aryan tradition. This is something that was introduced much later by Abrahamic scholars who reinterpreted Aryan myth to incorporate dualistic morality. Dualistic morality is a product of monotheism.

Dualistic morality is the chain. The promise of reward, the threat of punishment—these are the tools of the slaver.

Within the Abrahamic traditions, you are considered to be in the dream of God. Everything is rooted in the perception of oneness, of the divine Father, of God as the foundation of all consciousness. That means that everything is divine. However, there is only one central expression of personality that is allowed to exist within that system, and that is God. Everything that is below God is an illusion. You are a puppet for God.

We don't just take the approach of let's wipe everybody else out in the world who doesn't agree 100% with what we believe. That comes from that mind virus where everything has to be held to one specific standard, and if you do not agree with that, you're the infidel. You're poison. You need to be wiped off the face of the earth.

## The Spread of the Disease

The spread of Abrahamism in its many forms is rooted in the Vishuddhi. It is about the word, it is about the mind. It is about introspection, divine masculinity.

With the rise of Christianity, you had a sudden tearing away of the material foundation, because pagan culture at that time was extremely imminent. There was a deep connection to the blood, deep connection to Shakti, deep connection to the Swadhisthana, and a deep connection to the Manipura. Aryan culture at that time was extremely active. Suddenly you have ripped that away and you have thrown everything into contemplation. But were the Jews allowing the European people in the expression of Christianity to have access to any sort of foundation in reason, in logic, in the Vishuddhi, some kind of intellectual grounding that would allow them to poke holes in this new cult? No. What they did was they threw them into mysticism.

This is why you lost access to medicine. This is why you lost access to mathematics, to any sort of infrastructure that would help to advance civilization. Everything was thrown into the Dark Age. And in this Dark Age, you had intense paranoia, brutality, just unheard of brutality. Why was it so easy for Europeans to embrace the kind of sadistic brutality that you see in the Christian cult? The torture chambers. Why was it so easy to abuse women, the feminine principle?

Because if you're thrown into an intense state of contemplation with no grounding in Shakti, all you have left is divine masculinity. And that divine masculinity without any grounding in Shakti becomes intensely misogynistic. It also becomes intensely brutal in a physical sense. Because there is no respect for the body. There's no respect for the boundaries of the body. There's no respect for borders. There's no respect for the blood, there's no respect for physical pain. All sensation becomes subtle. There's a total disconnection. it's no big deal to torture someone. It's no big deal to have dead bodies strewn out through the streets, to have the rotten stench of trash everywhere and nobody cleans up anything.

It's an aspect of maladjusted sattvic behavior. The same disconnection that breeds slothful contempt for the body, now scaled to civilization. That's what you see with European Christianity at that time in the Dark Age.

## The Vacuum of Meaning

Nihilism is not an idea. It is a disease of the Vishuddhi—a great white shark swimming through the streams of modern consciousness, through art, science, philosophy, and politics.

You can catch the disease of nihilism by surrounding yourself with expressions of the diseased mind. If you swim with sharks, you can be consumed.

We exist at a time where maladjusted manifestations of Vishuddhi consciousness are encouraged by the social order. And what does that look like? It looks like social isolation, alienation, depression, anxiety, solipsism, radical skepticism, nihilism. This is the defining matrix of the contemporary manifestation of the global civilization, of modernity.

That is why schools like modern psychology have utterly failed to address the major maladjustments of consciousness which have manifested in modernity. That is why modern science has failed to give humanity any source of meaning and understanding and awareness that adds to the beauty of life. It has reduced everything to nihilism and solipsism. That is the end goal of science.

These are Nietzsche's last men, the pathetic remnants of a once healthy expression of the word shattered into a million pieces and spread across the globe. These men and women are possessed by the arrogance of an isolated intellect. They affirm radical skepticism in all forms. This skepticism only serves to uphold their sloth and inability to take definitive action in the advancement of any sort of higher beauty.

Academia is filled with these self fashioned cogs, bolstering the disease of their fellow mental masturbator in a massive circle jerk of peer review and institutional dogma.

In the midst of the intellectual dogma, the cult of comparative stoicism is formed. The man without emotion is held up as the ideal. Man is cut away from his passionate expression, his creative spark, his emotional honesty. In the present age, the elevation of the mind to supreme status has made it nearly impossible for the average man or woman to be emotionally honest.

## The Solar Cult Breeds Nihilism

This emptiness is the promise of every monotheistic religion and every expression of atheism. It is pure transcendence. It is nihilism.

What about the atheist? Some just throw their hands in the air and say, okay, I'm not going to be an adversary. But I'm just going to say that the gods don't exist and God doesn't exist. Well, all you've done at that point is you have undercut your ability to access the full expression of your consciousness. And so you're neutered. You are rendered impotent against the system.

When you embrace that perspective, you are ultimately playing right into the hand of the monotheistic system. Because monotheism leads back to the cosmic egg. It leads back to the monistic point, the place without differentiation, the ultimate nothingness, the blackness.

Even atheists kneel to Abrahamic morality, calling the carpenter a great teacher while denying his divinity. The virus does not require belief in gods—only submission to their values.

Even if you got rid of Christianity and Islam and Judaism, Abrahamism is in the culture. It's taken on secular forms. It's taken on forms that parade as paganism too. Abrahamism is an intellectual disease. It's a mental disorder.

## The Degeneration of Modernity

God operates with such subtlety that most people would deny the existence of God if not for some type of socio-cultural brainwashing. And even many of those individuals who call themselves Christians or Muslims or Jews, deep down, if you really question them, they are not really spiritual people. Most of the religiosity is a surface level religiosity. And keeping in step with the nature of the Kali Yuga, most of these people are expressing a religiosity that is extremely materialistic.

It is written:

*In the age of Kali, strength shall fade from the body, years shall be cut short, truth shall become a stranger, and memory shall dissolve like morning mist. A man's worth shall be measured only by the weight of his gold. The spirit shall become hollow in most hearts—a shell where once there burned a flame. Clever tongues shall be mistaken for wisdom, and the bond between man and woman shall mean nothing. Sacred places shall become empty stones. All concern shall turn to comfort, to acquisition, to the belly and the purse. Religion shall be worn like a mask to preserve one's standing among others.*

*Power shall be seized by force alone. The tax collector shall strip the people bare. Madness shall spread through the minds of men like plague. The old shall be cast aside to die alone. Greed shall set brother against brother, nation against nation. The priesthood shall rot from within. Fools shall parade as gurus, and atheists shall twist the sacred texts to serve their blindness. Those who rule shall feed upon the ruled like parasites. And those born to lead through wisdom shall lose all authority, for they shall have abandoned mastery of themselves.*

This is the age foretold. The Kali Yuga walks among us.

## The Exodus Begins

Less and less younger people are believing in this Abrahamic system. They're moving towards, whether it's witchcraft or it's yoga, they're moving towards these older sciences. Sciences that make sense because they offer direct experience rather than faith alone.

Christ offers nothing. Salvation is a promise that never arrives. And so they are held by force alone.

The Internet tears the veil. Communities form in digital shadows. Knowledge that was sealed for centuries now flows freely to those who seek it.

Christianity spread by the sword. The sword has grown dull.

---

## The Awakening

Something is shifting. We can feel it in the cultural tremors, in the mass exodus from organized religion, in the hunger for direct experience that no amount of consumer goods can satisfy. The existential nausea that plagued late modernity is transforming into something else. And in its place, we find the burgeoning cosmic horror of Lovecraft. If you want to know what is coming for all of us in terms of the global civilizational expression of consciousness, look to Lovecraft. Because Lovecraft captured the terrible awareness that comes with stepping out of the grounded point in the mind and realizing that this earth, this plane, is part of a much grander expression that reaches far beyond the present dimension of consciousness and brings us to vistas which are unimaginable to the average man.

## The Birth of New Gods

We're coming to a point in time when the old gods, the old traditions, have been so corrupted and transformed into part of this dream that we're going to have to give birth to new gods at some point. Yes, it will be the same essential essence, of course, of the gods of the past. But there will be new gods that will be reflective of the condition that we're facing now. There will be new traditions, new cults that form, that are reflective of the needs of now and the future.

When we form these truly rebellious systems, we have to embrace them in their fullest expression. We cannot allow ourselves to carry the baggage that we were raised with, because most of us were born into that cabal—into that dream. But we are all waking. Now that we have access to new instruments, new cultural spaces, we are able to form holy places that are not confined to any one geographic location.

## The End of Modernity

The Jewish age draws to its close. Modernity exhausts itself. The metaphysical Israel—that covenant, that promise—will shatter like all dreams shatter when the sleeper wakes.

In the ashes, new forms emerge. The Aryan tradition stirs. Those who have pushed consciousness to its highest transcendence now stand ready to descend, to reconnect with Shakti, with the blood, with the sacred boundaries of earth and body.

When transcendence reunites with immanence—when Shiva meets Shakti at the heart—then the age turns.

## The Barbarian at the Gate

Kali is the barbarian at the gate. She is the raw force of nature that reminds every civilization: if you become too soft, too civilized, too disconnected from the blood, you will be crushed.

The Aryan traditions begin with the mother cult. The son in rebellion against the aging patriarch gains his power from the mother. Mordred aligns with Morgana against Arthur. The lunar aspect feeds power to the rising sun. But when the patriarch refuses to share power, when the mother is rejected and placed in a bind, decadence sets in.

This is what happened with Brahmanic society. The solar aspect became obsessed with spirit over blood. The common people were forgotten. The connection to the land was severed. Within the Brahmanic order, the priests gained so much power that they felt they did not need to maintain connection to the shudra, let alone the outcasts of society. An intense focus on spirit over the blood. And this comes from obsession with transcendence at the expense of immanence.

And so the Kalikula formed: the children of Kali. A cult in absolute rejection of Brahmanic authority. Anti-lineage. Anti-dogma. The preservation of the mother for the time of revolution.

---

## The Children of Kali

All of this obsession with lineage that you find now, people focusing so intently on tracing their spiritual authority back nine, ten teachers—that is an obsession with Brahmanical culture, and that is decadence. Because what we have is an attempt to establish authority very similar to papal authority. The Kalikula rejected this entirely.

One of the common rituals of the Kalikula was for a yoga initiate of the left hand to find a woman of the lowest class possible. An untouchable woman—whether Dravidian or a woman of very low class, a prostitute or a thief or a drunk. Take this woman into the Kali temple and engage in ritual union.

This was not transgression for its own sake. It was deliberate inversion of the caste hierarchy. Bringing the outcast into the sacred center. The untouchable woman in the temple is not merely a ritual partner—she is Kali herself. The return of the repressed mother principle, forcing reconciliation between heights and depths.

The mother is the blood. And if you have no connection to this, you start to rot from your foundations. That is what leads to the destruction of a civilization. The Shudra mixed with the Dravidians and brought this dark mother force back into the Vedic civilization in the form of Kalima. The revolution from below.

Kali's name carries confusion by design. Kala means either time or blackness, depending on accent. The cultists who followed her, operating outside Brahmanic obsession with precise meaning, allowed the confusion to persist. Through chaos, through disorder, Kali communicates her nature. Time, death, blackness. The threefold blood. The most intense expression of divine femininity concentrated into jaws that rend and tear and bloody civilization so that something new can be created in its ashes.

## The Fire That Never Dies

The flame has been preserved. In the cremation grounds of India, the Aghoris kept watch through centuries of conquest. Now, in the digital cremation grounds, in spaces the old powers cannot reach, we tend the same fire.

This fire gives birth to gods. Gods that fuel the ships that will carry us to new worlds. Gods that offer beauty instead of tyranny. Purpose instead of shame. Life instead of the slow death of transcendence without return.

We will walk beside these gods as equals. Not slaves. Not puppets. Sovereign beings who have passed through the darkness and emerged carrying our own light.

The people get the gods they deserve. A dedicated few, aligned with the dharma of the age—with Shakti, with the Dark Mother—have always determined what comes next. it was. So it shall be.

We affirm life. We carry the fire forward.

*The spirit is a whisper in the howling wind.*
