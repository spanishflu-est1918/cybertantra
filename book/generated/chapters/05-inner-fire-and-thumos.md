# Chapter 5: Inner Fire and Thumos

## The Spark Within

Tummo. The goddess of heat. Her flame rises through the spine. The Tibetans knew this. The Greeks knew this as thumos. We who practice know the fire is one fire.

The Inner Fire is Shakti herself, coiled and waiting. She is the spiritedness that drives action, the radiant power that demands expression.

Blood is passion. The seat of fire. Kali drinks it. The tantric knows this: blood and Shakti are one. The Inner Fire is daemonic. It is material. It moves through matter, seeking expression.


## The Platonic Architecture

Plato knew the soul was tripartite: nous, thumos, epithumia. Intellect, passion, appetite. The higher chakras, the middle chakras, the lower chakras. The Greeks mapped the same territory.

Thumos and epithumia are daemonic—rooted in lust and passion. Bring them under the will. This is the Greek method. The yogi who gains control of his daemons achieves unification. Power expands to its highest potential.


## The Manipura: Seat of Fire

The Manipura chakra, seated at the navel, is the hardest to navigate in modernity. Modernity is the age of the Vishuddhi. The Vishuddhi is adversarial to the Manipura. Opposite poles of the same axis.

Manipura: inner fire, creativity, expression, passion, emotion. Vishuddhi: introspection, intellect, mind, air, coolness.

Fire feeds on air. Air carries fire. Too much air extinguishes the flame. This is why the age of ideas has killed passion in men.

Modernity is the age of the Vishuddhi—ideas, mentalization, the intellect severed from its source. The order of the day is that which is cool, that which is airy, that which is of the mind alone. If you are a being constituted by fire, you exist surrounded by a whirlwind that seeks to snuff you out.


## The Nature of the Ram

The animal of the Manipura is the ram. Impulsive. Fearless. It scales mountains and charges directly into rivals. It abandons all concern for its own well-being in the expression of its will. Study the ram. Become the ram.

Stand in a stall with goats at feeding time. They do not even know you are there. They push each other, trying to get the hay from your hands. The moment food appears, they ram into each other. It is their food. They must be there first. No careful lines. No shared space. They fight immediately for what they want.

All emotion originates in the Manipura. Fear rises—face it, fight it, or flee. Fear is a barrier we burn up in the gut. It is fuel. Fuel for the tapas. Fuel for the inner fire. Throw that fear onto the pyre of the Manipura. Feed that fire up into the wind. Throw lightning bolts.


## The Place of the Womb

The belly is the womb. All creation gestates here. The novel, the song, the movement, the child—all are born from the same fire.

When we accumulate prana and express it creatively, we experience esoteric pregnancy and childbirth. The manipura is the seat of all mothering energy, the creative spark of Shakti herself.

The guitar in the corner. The manuscript in the drawer. The song unsung. These are your children waiting to be born. Pick it up. Now.

Beauty is impractical. The marketplace has no claim on your passion. This creative pursuit is as essential as asana, as vital as pranayama. The warrior creates.


## Soma: The Secret Nectar

Soma is the drink of the gods. The nectar of immortality. Ancient beyond the Vedas. The Soma cults predate written memory. In proto Indo-Aryan culture, Soma was the central force of life, creativity, and inspiration.

From the Rigveda: We have drunk Soma and become immortal. We have attained the light the gods discovered. Now, what may foeman's malice do to harm us? What, O immortal, mortal man's deception?

The drink that brings immortality. The fountain of youth. The Apple of Eden. Consume this nectar and you are sustained forever. Nothing your enemies do can defeat you. You remain powerful for eternity. long as you have Soma.

The Rigveda states the moon is the cup from which the gods drink Soma. The moon is the divine feminine, Shakti. In the solar cycle, we associate the moon with the Mooladhara—the full moon, the physical world, the physical body.

The vessel that holds Soma is the blood. The body. When the gods drink from the cup, they drink from their own body or the body of another. You are the vessel of Soma.

The ingredients for Soma grow on the mountain. The mountain of consciousness. The spine. Mount Meru. Mount Olympus. Yggdrasil. This mountain is not purely physical. It exists just beyond the realm of matter.


## The Eagle and the Guardians

Soma is said to reside in the heavens. And it is said in the Aryan mythology that Soma is brought down by an eagle, brought to the people, brought to the gods by an eagle. An eagle who risks his life to bring that beautiful drink to us.

This is Prometheus bringing the spark of life down to man, to give him access to godhood. And it is dangerous. It is a dangerous endeavor for the eagle.

The mountain where Soma resides is not merely geographical. It represents states of consciousness beyond ordinary perception. The mountain lies beyond the horizon. And what does the horizon represent? It represents the limits of our perception. Breaking through perceptual limitations allows one to find that holy mountain and climb it. As we climb the mountain, we stumble across that tall green stalk, that proud strong base that holds up this beautiful yellow fire. And we grasp that fire and we grind that stalk and we create that nectar and drink it.

But the mountain is guarded.

The Gandharvas cherish Soma. The Gandharvas are the defenders of Soma. They are like the wrathful deities that prevent you from being able to access that sacred drink. In tantric iconography, wrathful guardians stand at the threshold of every sacred space. They test worthiness. They destroy those who approach without preparation.

And yet the Gandharvas are also the holy musicians in the court of Indra. The guardians who prevent access are themselves intimately connected to the divine court. This presents a paradox: the obstacle is the path. One must understand and perhaps become like the Gandharvas to pass them.

If you can overcome them, you can gain Soma and you can keep it. Because once you understand how to create Soma, once you know the formula, once you grind that beautiful plant within, you have a never-ending supply.

Note the phrase: grind that beautiful plant within. The esoteric Soma is an internal process, not merely an external substance. The eagle's descent mirrors the practitioner's descent into embodiment—bringing divine fire into mortal form. The danger is real. Not everyone who seeks Soma survives the encounter with the Gandharvas. But for those who do, the supply becomes inexhaustible.


## The Recipe of Fire

In the Vedas, Soma grows only in the mountains. A tall green plant with bright yellow hair. Take the yellow hair and the green stalk. Pound it against a rock until you generate heat. That heat generates excitement. This is how you create Soma.

The green stalk is the heart—Anahata willpower. Express will. Grind will against stone. Act willfully in the physical world. Assert your position in physicality. The stone is blood. It is the sword you carry. The shield you carry. The enemy you cut down. The castle you build. The lover you embrace. The brother you carry.

Apply the will to power in the physical world. Generate heat. The belly generates heat. The fire in the belly. That is the light. The rising sun. The bright light we gain when we drink Soma.

The fire in the belly, the Manipura, the rising sun. That is Soma. That is the secret.


## The Suppression of Fire

The great trap of our age: suppression of willpower, suppression of passion within a dispassionate environment. Those born rooted in the Manipura are by nature adversarial to the prevailing age. Natural social outcasts. The Manipura in modernity is socially unacceptable.

Society is structured to discourage Manipura and encourage decadent Vishuddhi. Entire institutions exist to achieve this. Chief among them: modern psychology. A Vishuddhi institution that attempts to answer all questions of consciousness through the framework of the mind alone.

Modern psychology spreads as a religion. Its great religious text is the DSM. This text passes judgment on all states of consciousness. Millions misdiagnosed. Treatments that cause more damage than they heal.

The goal: flatten the emotions. Turn everyone into a maladjusted Vishuddhi person. Everyone must conform. This is the nature of social order.


## Igniting the Flame

Most of us exist within conditions hostile to the preservation of inner fire. Ignite the flame. Keep it. This is difficult in modernity. Do it anyway.

It begins at waking. The body is a stove, an engine. When the spark ignites, that is the time to act. The time to turn up the gas. The time to get the flame burning. Hesitate and the fire dies. Reigniting costs everything.

Sleep is receptive. Energy accumulates for the spark. At waking, that spark ignites. Now keep it. The universe has given you this fire. What will you do with it?

Rise. Act. The warrior exposes himself immediately to conditions that inflame the spark in the belly.


## Methods of Cultivation

Bhastrika pranayama. The primary technique for keeping the flame burning. Breathe rapidly. Bring air down into the belly. Perform the bandha, the lock on the manipura. Create heat within the body.

Expose yourself to the cold. Surround yourself with cold to encourage heat within. The body responds to its environment by generating heat. Cold showers. Cold baths. Morning runs in the cold. The body adapts by burning hotter.

Odin is the yogic figure of the Norse tradition. Associated with the breath. The harsh cold of Scandinavia required the development of inner resolve. By cultivating the Inner Flame, the Norse adapted to their environment. They did not flee the cold. They became fire.

First thing in the morning: choose war. Choose bloodshed. Bhastrika practice. Cold exposure. Movement. Asanas. Do something. The morning sets the trajectory.

Diet stimulates inner fire. Rajasic foods. Aphrodisiacs like chocolate stimulate the anahata, adjacent to the manipura. Spicy foods. Citrus. Foods that stimulate the gut, get everything flowing. The warrior feeds the fire.


## The Will to Power

Nietzsche is Anahata. His philosophy is the heart and the will to power—what we seek on the left hand path.

Accept as much pain as the pleasure you seek. Accept this great divide, this contrast. Give yourself fully to expression at least once. Otherwise you will never know what is there. You cannot fully realize the self without great risk.

The universe knocks us on our ass. It makes us experience both sides of the heart. Pain and pleasure. Happiness and sadness. Love and hate. Both sides are necessary. Remain an individuated consciousness long enough and suffering will find you.

On the left hand path, we do not seek to escape suffering. The right hand path escapes attachments, overcomes the self—the ascetic path of Ascending Yoga. Escape duality and you reach non-duality: no distinction between pain and pleasure, happiness and sadness, love and hate. No suffering because no pleasure.

For many, that is not their Dharma. They are not living. Not truly living. They possess consciousness, a degree of awareness, but that is not life. Life is fire. Life is creation. Life is electricity.


## Throwing Lightning

The Vajra is a lightning weapon. A power conductor. It directs prana—bringing it in, expressing it out. Indra carries it. Thor carries Mjolnir. Zeus wields the lightning bolt. Perun. Jupiter. The weapon is the same.

The Anahata is electricity and magnetism. Lightning. Fire on the wind. This is how we create lightning alchemically: take the fire at the belly, the tapas at the manipura, and combine it with the wild wind, the air, the mind of the Vishuddhi. Between manipura and Vishuddhi rests the anahata. The heart. Fire on the wind. Lightning.

Thor is rooted in the anahata. Champion of beauty. Dharma. Expression of the will. The hammer directs his power. He applies his will in the most active sense.

Nietzsche philosophized with a hammer. We know what hammer. We know what weapon.


## Life Affirmation

The assault on the extremity of life—on the passionate embrace of life, on quality over quantity—is a direct attack on your ability to preserve the will at the heart and express it for eternity. A direct attack on self-deification. On godhood. On polytheism. On everything we hold dear. On the beauty of life itself. On art.

Something deep in your heart that you truly love but are afraid to express. Something people have suppressed to the point where you no longer look to the chambers of your heart to see what is there. If you perceived that beautiful thing you can no longer embrace, the defeat would be unbearable.

Express it. That is how you throw lightning.

Get loud. Stand firm. Throw lightning. What follows lightning? Thunder. Express that thing essential to you. Do it with full embrace of the beauty of being an expressive force. Listen for the thunder.

Zeus does not care what the peasants think when he throws a lightning bolt. All he hears is the thunder.


## The Eternal Youth

Man must steal Soma from the gods. This is the key of the Aryan tradition. The gods are adversarial to man. On one side the gods, on the other the giants. Devas and Asuras. Aesir and Jotun. Both sides want to destroy us. But if we gain access to the secret of their power, we overcome them. We witness the twilight of the gods.

This is what the gods fear. Man gaining access to immortality. Man becoming God. The Ubermensch. Soma is the lifeblood of the Ubermensch. Access Soma and become the superman. Reign over the gods.

Part of the regenerative cycle, part of what keeps us youthful: always seeking a new horizon. Not satisfied with decadent tyranny. Not sitting on the throne, looking down, doing nothing. Always seeking the next horizon. Affirming the beauty of youth. The Nietzschean call to youth. The golden lion's mane. That beautiful yellow hair on the green stalk. The fire in the belly. The Manipura. The rising sun.

Live. Throw lightning. Ride the wind. Grasp the fire in your belly. See the fire borne on the wind. Express the lightning, hear the thunder. This is what it means to wield the vajra. This is the lightning weapon.

Do not let anyone tell you to suppress what you are passionate about. Do not let anyone extinguish your love for life, your spark.

Find Soma. Distill it. Extract it. Sprinkle it. Give it to others. Be a youthful expression. Be a rising sun to other people. Inspire them to search. Go west beyond the horizon. Find the sacred drink that grants immortality.
