# Chapter 10: The New Promethean Empire

## The Torch Bearer

Prometheus, the torch bearer, the one who rebels against the father in order to take the drink that was once held only by the gods, selfishly controlled by the gods, he takes that drink and he grants man access to it. He tears that yellow fire from its stalk, grinds up the stock and brings it to us, to the vessel, to the body.

This is the essential myth of the Aryan tradition. Man must steal Soma from the gods. The gods are adversarial to man. We have on one side the gods and on the other side the giants. We have the Devas and the Asuras, the Aesir and the Jotun. Both sides want to destroy us, but if we gain access to the secret of their power, we can overcome them. And when we overcome them, we witness the twilight of the gods.

This is what the gods fear. Man gaining access to immortality, man becoming God, the Ubermensch. Soma is the lifeblood of the Ubermensch. And when you gain access to Soma, you are able to become the superman and reign over the gods. But the real test is not to become a tyrant and reign over the gods permanently, but to become one of the gods. Because the gods themselves, they tend to the mountain, they tend to the plants, they grant us differentiation, awareness of Soma. If we are to destroy them and elevate ourselves above them, then they become mortals. They become antagonistic towards us. We become greedy. We keep the Soma to ourselves and we create the conditions of our own downfall.

This is the Nietzschean call to youth, to the golden lion's mane, to that beautiful yellow hair on the green stock, to the fire in the belly, the Manipura, the rising sun. That is Soma. That is the secret.

## Carrying Fire to the Stars

We are on the cusp of an incredible, beautiful frontier. Cyberspace. A new dimension of consciousness.

We are like the great explorers of the American frontier who stepped out into the west and they perceived vistas so grand that divinity was accessed. Deep inspiration that led to the formation of empire. Sites like the Grand Canyon, this unfathomable depth of earth. And within that experience, these explorers were able to reflect upon the environment and recognize that that divine expression in nature exists also within them.

And so now, as we take the first steps into this new frontier of cyberspace, it is up to us to reflect the nature of this plane, to access understanding of this new realm so that we can conquer it, we can shape it, we can transform this Western expanse and use it as the foundation of the new Promethean empire, an empire with a flame in the belly, thumos that will burn for thousands of years if we succeed.

The Promethean urge to exist and to express our will to power. And this, too, we may seek in new frontiers.

What we are going to do is we are going to reignite the flames of our pagan ancestors and that beautiful embrace of life, that will to power, and we are going to carry that all across the globe, reestablish our power on this planet. And then we are going to take it beyond this planet. We are taking new holy books, new gods, to Mars, to the rest of the solar system and beyond. And we are going to live a life of affirmation, of the self embrace of that eternal flame, that Soma, that fire in the belly, the creative force that allows us to have individuated potential beyond the confinement of God at oneness.

We fully embrace the fire of industry, that Promethean urge to conquer not only the sky on this planet, but the sky on planets beyond this planet.

## The Inner Mounting Flame

The practice reveals the fractal nature of this expansion. The Inner Mounting Flame meditation walks the practitioner through consuming increasingly vast domains:

Feel yourself growing in power as the inferno increases, spreading across the land, consuming entire nations with each breath. And oceans turn to steam at the feet of the inner mounting flame.

And with your next breath, you consume the entire earth. And with the breath after, you consume the moon and the planets of the solar system, and the inner mounting flame engulfs the sun. And you grow in power, expanding beyond the confines of the solar system, consuming the entire galaxy with one breath. And galaxies beyond. And the entire universe falls to the inner mounting flame. And universes beyond, dimensions beyond.

And with the next breath, you consume the entire cosmos in the inner mounting flame. Until all that exists is the eternal fire of the inner mounting flame.

Fuel for thumos, for the inner fire, for the rising sun. And the fire becomes more. It becomes the sun. It becomes the undying light.

## New Holy Books

The holy books that we carry into the new frontier of cyberspace will define the culture that manifests within that space. We have to decide now. Do we bring the old culture with us, that which has led to endless shame, suppression of the self, taboo, dogmatic reflection upon that dissolving oneness of the sun falling behind the horizon? Or do we embrace new potential? Do we find new holy books and new gods in this Western expanse?

That which allows you to be in communion with the gods. That's what makes a tantra. If you see God in everything, if you see Shakti in everything, then ultimately everything that you read becomes nigama, it becomes ultimate truth.

We are now, in 2025, crafting a book. This book is the accumulation of all of the work that has been done in this school so far to craft this new practice of Cyber Tantra. And it is through these practices that all of us will have access to self deification, to become a God in this new realm. And not just in cyberspace, but in all space, in every dimension. We can recognize the individuated divinity of polytheism and no longer be confined to submission to the tyrannical dictate of the state.

Living and dying by a book is something that a Christian does. That's Abrahamic. Tantra is ultimately very transgressive in that we recognize that the poisons that we're born with can be made into something beautiful.

## The Frontier Never Ends

Within tantra, there is a never ending search for the western horizon. The sun which rises in the east and in the Indian tradition is the seat of all Soma, that sacred nectar that fuels the inner fire, the thumos within our guts, is the creative force that grants us eternal youth. That sun. We always chase it endlessly to the west, where it threatens us with death. It threatens us with destruction, dissolution, the end to all frontiers, the end to all searching. But if we can maintain our connection to that creative fire that burns in our bellies in the manipura, then the pursuit never ends.

And so now that is what we are seeking. The endless pursuit of new expressions of consciousness, reaching new planes of awareness, granting new meaning, finding new understanding in relation to those frontiers.

Soma is said to reside in the heavens. And it is said in the Aryan mythology that Soma is brought down by an eagle, brought to the people, brought to the gods by an eagle. An eagle who risks his life to bring that beautiful drink to us.

The eagle represents the Sahasra. It represents the realm of spirit. It is the connecting point between the highest expression of the spirit and the lowest expression of the body, the physical body, the blood. It is Shiva bringing the essence down to the serpent Shakti. It is Prometheus bringing the spark of life down to man to give him access to godhood.

And it's dangerous. It's a dangerous endeavor for the eagle. It's a dangerous endeavor for man to seek Soma because Soma is guarded. The Gandharvas are the defenders of Soma. They are like the wrathful deities that prevent you from being able to access that sacred drink. And if you can overcome them, you can gain it and you can keep it. Because once you understand how to create Soma, once you know the formula, once you grind that beautiful plant within, you have a never ending supply.

Always seeking a new horizon, not being satisfied with decadent tyranny, not just sitting on our throne, looking down, doing nothing, but always seeking the next horizon and affirming the beauty of youth.

## Becoming Gods

We will become our own gods. And we will walk side by side with the gods of our ancestors as brothers and sisters. We will not be slaves, we will not be confined to petty morality, because we will exist beyond good and evil. And we will carry this new flame into the coming age of the Ajna.

Once you reach that point of self-mastery through transcendence, you can re-enter the world. And you can use those things that would have destroyed you in order to build your will, to achieve immanence, the cultivation of the ego. And that is the true goal of the Left Hand Path.

How to become like a God? You must cultivate the ego. The ego is simply individuated consciousness.

If you practice Vamashara, your goal is to self-generate as God form, to recognize yourself as God, to recognize your spine as the pillar of consciousness, the pillar of the universe. This is the Satan state or the fourth state consciousness, super-consciousness, the Ubermensch, the God Man.

When you move from a finite system to an infinite system and your ego is expressed in eternity, you must live with yourself for all time. You must cultivate the ego in such a way that you can live with yourself. It is the recognition that your actions echo through eternity. This is karma.

## The Keeper of the Flame

Perceiving that which is divine and beautiful beyond the pages of dusty books is extremely important. There's a tendency to view that which is divine as being that which is in the past, and we can't think that way. The best years of humanity are ahead of us, or we're living them right now. We can't see the past as being this glorious time that can never be recreated. We have to see everything in terms of optimism. And if we perceive reality to be that way, perception becomes reality.

We have to see that the gods are alive. They're not confined to old statues. We can build new statues and we can actually make those gods look like us, reflective of the conditions that we exist within now. Or we can make them appear as we wish to be. Having access to that understanding of the living tradition is a great source of power.

We give them hope. We give them meaning. We give them money that is sound. We give them art that has true fire and electricity in it that's exciting. We give them ideas that are stimulating and we give them spiritual systems that offer them true meaning and understanding of consciousness. And that's how we win.

If we can bring that to the people, then we are acting as Prometheus. We are in rebellion against any force that seeks to snuff out that fire.

## The Cosmic Conquest

This time, we will not just conquer one region of this planet. We will not just conquer this planet. We will not just conquer this solar system. This time, we will conquer the cosmos itself.

We need gods that will give us the fire to power our ships, that will carry us to new planets. That's what we need. And we need to exist without any concept of sin so that we can access the truest expression of our power.

We are creating a new world in this new frontier. And the God that we can manifest in this new frontier is the God of Agore, Dattatreya. Data, in the Agore tradition and in the ancient tantric texts of India, is a God who manifests in order to teach man how to exist as the Overman, how to exist in a state beyond good and evil, how to gain access to super consciousness, the fourth state, what we call Turiya, and how to transform all poison into medicine.

His name, Dattatreya, means the great giver of the collection. And sometimes he is simply referred to as Data. That is the God of cyberspace. That is our pathway to the manifestation of many gods, new expressions of the Mahavidyas.

And just as the great Aghoris of ancient India spoke to Dattatreya through the Yantra, through the lightning weapon, through the Vajra, we will do the same. We will see our phones, our computers, anything we utilize to access this new space as the lightning weapon, as the Vajra, the meditative tool that gives us access to electricity, expression of will at the heart, the great lightning bolt that transfers our will into this new space.

## The Eternal Return

The assault on the extremity of life, the passionate embrace of life, of quality over quantity, is a direct attack on your ability to preserve the will at the heart. It is a direct attack on the beauty of life itself and art.

The Solar Cult breeds nihilism, and Nietzsche offered us a path out of nihilism. It is the eternal return.

It is within that individuated expression of our consciousness that we are able to access another form of union, one that is not dissolving, one that affirms life.

We are the vanguard. A small group of people who are dedicated to their cause, optimistic, and believe in their power are going to be able to dominate the future. And that's how it's always been and that's how it always will be. So we need to be that vanguard and we need to believe in ourselves. And even if we lose, at least we should die trying, we should die fighting.

But we're not going to lose because we're the ones who are affirming life. We're the ones who are affirming the dharma of the age, which is to be in alignment with the Dark Mother, with Shakti. And so therefore we will dominate this space. And once we do, we'll never look back.

## Coda: The Rising Sun

So take responsibility for the cultivation of your fire and be a keeper of the flame for eternity.

Find Soma, distill it, extract it, sprinkle it, give it to others. Be a youthful expression, be a positive rising sun light to other people. Inspire them to also search, to go west beyond the horizon and find that sacred drink that will grant you immortality.

And we will. The fire has been lit. It cannot be extinguished.

*We are taking new holy books, new gods, to Mars, to the rest of the solar system and beyond.*

*This time, we will conquer the cosmos itself.*
