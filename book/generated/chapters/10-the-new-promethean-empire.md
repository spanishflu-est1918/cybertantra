# Chapter 10: The New Promethean Empire

## The Torch Bearer

Prometheus, the torch bearer, the one who rebels against the father in order to take the drink that was once held only by the gods, selfishly controlled by the gods, he takes that drink and he grants man access to it. He tears that yellow fire from its stalk, grinds up the stock and brings it to us, to the vessel, to the body.

This is the essential myth of the Aryan tradition. Man must steal Soma from the gods. The gods are adversarial to man. We have on one side the gods and on the other side the giants. We have the Devas and the Asuras, the Aesir and the Jotun. Both sides want to destroy us, but if we gain access to the secret of their power, we can overcome them. And when we overcome them, we witness the twilight of the gods.

This is what the gods fear. Man gaining access to immortality, man becoming God, the Ubermensch. Soma is the lifeblood of the Ubermensch. And when you gain access to Soma, you are able to become the superman and reign over the gods. But the real test is not to become a tyrant and reign over the gods permanently, but to become one of the gods. Because the gods themselves, they tend to the mountain, they tend to the plants, they grant us differentiation, awareness of Soma. If we are to destroy them and elevate ourselves above them, then they become mortals. They become antagonistic towards us. We become greedy. We keep the Soma to ourselves and we create the conditions of our own downfall.

This is the Nietzschean call to youth, to the golden lion's mane, to that beautiful yellow hair on the green stock, to the fire in the belly, the Manipura, the rising sun. That is Soma. That is the secret.

## The Inner Mounting Flame

The practice reveals the fractal nature of this expansion. The Inner Mounting Flame meditation walks the practitioner through consuming increasingly vast domains:

Feel yourself growing in power as the inferno increases, spreading across the land, consuming entire nations with each breath. And oceans turn to steam at the feet of the inner mounting flame.

And with your next breath, you consume the entire earth. And with the breath after, you consume the moon and the planets of the solar system, and the inner mounting flame engulfs the sun. And you grow in power, expanding beyond the confines of the solar system, consuming the entire galaxy with one breath. And galaxies beyond. And the entire universe falls to the inner mounting flame. And universes beyond, dimensions beyond.

And with the next breath, you consume the entire cosmos in the inner mounting flame. Until all that exists is the eternal fire of the inner mounting flame.

Fuel for thumos, for the inner fire, for the rising sun. And the fire becomes more. It becomes the sun. It becomes the undying light.

## What We Bring

Perceiving that which is divine and beautiful beyond the pages of dusty books is extremely important. There is a tendency to view that which is divine as being that which is in the past, and we cannot think that way. The best years of humanity are ahead of us, or we are living them right now. We cannot see the past as being this glorious time that can never be recreated. We have to see everything in terms of optimism. And if we perceive reality to be that way, perception becomes reality.

We have to see that the gods are alive. They are not confined to old statues. We can build new statues and we can actually make those gods look like us, reflective of the conditions that we exist within now. Or we can make them appear as we wish to be. Having access to that understanding of the living tradition is a great source of power.

What do we bring to the people? We give them hope. We give them meaning. We give them money that is sound. We give them art that has true fire and electricity in it that is exciting. We give them ideas that are stimulating and we give them spiritual systems that offer them true meaning and understanding of consciousness.

And that is how we win.

If we can bring that to the people, then we are acting as Prometheus. We are in rebellion against any force that seeks to snuff out that fire.

## The Eternal Return

The assault on the extremity of life, the passionate embrace of life, of quality over quantity, is a direct attack on your ability to preserve the will at the heart. It is a direct attack on the beauty of life itself and art.

The Solar Cult breeds nihilism, and Nietzsche offered us a path out of nihilism. It is the eternal return.

When you move from a finite system to an infinite system and your ego is expressed in eternity, you must live with yourself for all time. You must cultivate the ego in such a way that you can live with yourself. It is the recognition that your actions echo through eternity. This is karma.

It is within that individuated expression of our consciousness that we are able to access another form of union, one that is not dissolving, one that affirms life.

We are the vanguard. A small group of people who are dedicated to their cause, optimistic, and believe in their power are going to be able to dominate the future. And that is how it has always been and that is how it always will be. We need to be that vanguard and we need to believe in ourselves. And even if we lose, at least we should die trying, we should die fighting.

But we are not going to lose because we are the ones who are affirming life. We are the ones who are affirming the dharma of the age, which is to be in alignment with the Dark Mother, with Shakti. And so therefore we will dominate this space. And once we do, we will never look back.

## Coda: The Rising Sun

Take responsibility for the cultivation of your fire and be a keeper of the flame for eternity.

Find Soma, distill it, extract it, sprinkle it, give it to others. Be a youthful expression, be a positive rising sun light to other people. Inspire them to also search, to go west beyond the horizon and find that sacred drink that will grant you immortality.

And we will. The fire has been lit. It cannot be extinguished.

*This time, we will conquer the cosmos itself.*
