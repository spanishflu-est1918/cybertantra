# Chapter 8: The Left Hand Path

## The Second Birth

The Left Hand Path begins when you are reborn.

If you have not gone through that baptism in the sun and achieved ego death, you are not a Left Hand Path yogin. You are playing at darkness while still enslaved to the light.

The Right Hand Path is a method for achieving a very specific goal. That goal being ego death, mastery of the self. Once you have achieved this, then you may walk the Left Hand Path. The sequence admits no shortcuts: you go from Mooladhara to the Svadhisthana to the Manipura, Anahata, Vishuddhi, Ajna, Sahasrara. When you reach the Sahasrara, your goal is to have a clear light experience, to reach transcendence, to kill the ego. You have to die so that you may be reborn.

Many of the gurus and sages that reach the Sahasrara are trapped there. They never complete the first initiation. They dissolve into the light and are lost. If you walk the Right Hand Path only and you orient your consciousness towards transcendence, you will escape the cycle of rebirth. But you will dissolve entirely. Everything that was you will be gone. You will live in total submission to the will of the Sky Father.

This is why pure transcendence is so heavily promoted by the solar cult, by the Right Hand Path schools of magic. When you reach the point of transcendence, you reach the point of total detachment. You achieve ego death. And when you achieve ego death, you are no longer a threat to the Sky Father. He does not have to see you as a rival anymore. Because the Sky Father hates anything that does not dissolve into his own consciousness.

But there is a point beyond transcendence.

Once you reach that point of self-mastery through transcendence, you can re-enter the world. And you can use those things that would have destroyed you in order to build your will, in order to express your power, in order to achieve self-realization, in order to achieve immanence, the cultivation of the ego. And that is the true goal of the Left Hand Path.

## Vamachara: The Path of the Left Hand

The Left Hand Path within the Indian tradition is known as Vamachara. Vamachara is a path in which you embrace all that is taboo. The borders of what is acceptable in the practice are dissolved. The only thing that matters in Vamachara is the pursuit of power. That which brings you power is good, and that which undermines your power is bad.

Practitioners of Vamachara who truly are capable of empowering the self recognize non-duality. They do not confine themselves to ideas of good and evil. Those ideas are just further barriers from the ultimate truth. Whether that takes the form of oneness with God or cultivation of ultimate power within the self.

You have reached the peak of the mountain, but you do not remain at the peak. To remain at the peak is to remain in a state of transcendence. Instead, what you do is you cross over to the other side of the mountain. And once you do that, and you start the descent, this is the descending path of yoga, which we call Vamachara, or the Left Hand Path.

Once we have ascended to the peak, our new foundation of consciousness is transcendence or emptiness. So with this foundation of emptiness, we can now descend.

In Vamachara, the idea is that you are releasing yourself from dogma, you are releasing yourself from the orthodox practice as much as possible. And in doing so, you are able to gain access to other elements of the self that might not otherwise be entertained. Within Vamachara there is an emphasis on release from ideas of caste, from ideas of lineage, from all taboo. Because the orthodoxy, though it may be a bridge to greater power on the left hand path, it should not be pursued for its own sake.

## Compulsion and Indulgence

When we allow Shakti to dictate the way that we behave, we are in a state of compulsion. And ultimately, the Right Hand Path is all about removing compulsion, so that when we reach the Left Hand Path we can engage with indulgence.

This is the distinction we explored earlier: compulsion means no choice, indulgence means you choose. You regain your humanity. You are able to express your will and you are free from a state of reactivity.

Most people do not possess the ability to express their will in this manner. They exist almost entirely in a state of reactivity. There is no pleasure in compulsion. There is just slavery. This applies to all domains: sexuality, consumption, technology, relationships. The drive to connect with shakti leads men to become compulsive in their sexuality. They are slaves to women. They live totally in compulsion to the will of women.

You must have emptiness within you before you can embrace desirous attachment, because otherwise desirous attachment becomes compulsion, and you are destroyed by it.

From the point of transcendence, you can taste dissolution. You can taste differentiation. And you can indulge in one aspect or the other. You can choose to be dissolved. Or you can choose to be differentiated. You are able to exist with indulgence rather than compulsion as your foundation. Even reincarnation itself becomes a choice rather than an automatic process.

## The Transformation of Poison

In practicing the Left Hand Path, those things that we once considered to be degenerate, immoral, poisonous, wrong, destructive, we seek means by which we can transform those things into nectar. This is the yoga of nectar that you find in the highest yoga Tantra.

The perspective of Tantra is that everything we experience must be purified. It must be transformed into nectar or medicine. And this is the process of transforming poison into medicine.

All of these things that caused us suffering when we interacted with them, we now try to re-examine these things from a foundation of emptiness so that we can integrate them. And instead of causing suffering within us, these things now lead to pleasure.

What are the poisons? The Panchamakara, the five M's, the five great poisons: Madhya, which consists of drugs of all sorts. Mamsa, which is meat, the flesh of any living creature, including humans. Matsya, fish. Mudra, grain. And Maithuna, sex.

Each of these poisons represents that which is poisonous to us in our present dimension of consciousness. And that which is poisonous to us in an immediate sense is of shakti. It is material. It is the self and all things surrounding the self, all differentiated things. And so we must protect ourselves from these poisons if we wish to preserve the self.

But after the second birth, the practitioner gains what the sources call the will to indulge:

You begin with this new life. You are second born. Once you complete this initiation, and in this second born state, you now have the will to indulge, to choose what aspects of consciousness you want to integrate.

## The Beast and the God

If you bring your awareness to Bhairava, you access something specific: the ability to be a beast and a God.

Bhairava is the ferocious manifestation of Shiva. He is like the divine masculine, the urge towards order, expressing itself on the furthest point from its root. Because divine masculine order is rooted in the Sahasrara. And if you take it as far away from its home position as you possibly can, you reach the muladhara. And this is where you would find the manifestation of Bhairava.

Consider what that means. It means that you are dragging the sun down into the depths of darkness. You are forcefully bringing the light into the shadow. You are eclipsing the sun. And so if you are rooted in divine masculine order, but you embrace the greatest extreme of shakti, you can act in the most animalistic fashion, but still be far more than just a simple animal.

The Aghoris, they practice bhakti on Bhairava by taking on his essence. If you view the iconography associated with Bhairava, you will find this wild man in the forest with an unkempt beard and long dreadlocks, drinking blood or alcohol from a human skull. And this is the form that the Aghoris are assuming. But this form goes far beyond the physical presentation, because the Aghori tradition is all about accessing the fullest spectrum of consciousness.

There are Aghoris who wear the dreadlocks, they have the unkempt beard, they drink from the skull. But there are Aghoris who wear business suits, attend corporate meetings, they drink coffee from a mug. But within them is the same bestial nature that they have embraced alongside the purifying aspect of Shiva.

The Left Hand Path in its representation within the cosmos is as varied as there are people in the world. You can walk the Left Hand Path and look like Mr. Rogers, and you can walk the Right Hand Path and be Ted Bundy.

## Satan: The Condition of Becoming God

Satan is not an individual being. He is not a man with horns. He is not a goat. He is not even a he. There is no being known as Satan. Satan, properly understood, is a condition. And this condition precedes Abrahamism by thousands of years.

The word's true origin is Sanskrit. Sat: God, existence, being. Tan: to spread, to continue, to become. Satan is the condition of becoming God.

What does it mean to be fully self-realized? Either one develops to the point where they are absorbed into the Godhead, becoming one with God, or one transcends the cycle of time and becomes an individuated being beyond time, outside of time, no longer conditioned by it, but now master of time. This is what it means to be Sat.

And so any individual who is on a path towards self-realization, whether that individual seeks total unification with the Godhead or seeks individuated expression, that individual is Satan. They are of the condition of Satan.

When we examine the word Satan, we find great richness in its magical application. To spread one's essence or will beyond God. This is to overcome the tyrannical aspects of the Godhead. And by doing so you cover the sun. This is to spread one's individuated nature to be as the black sun. And so we see here a direct relationship between Satan and the Black Sun.

At its core: Satanism is the affirmation of life, of the human condition, and of the will to power. Because at its core, the will to power is all about self-realization. Power, properly understood, is the expression of one's Dharma coming into oneself. This is the ultimate expression of power.

And so yoga leading to Satan means that yogic practices, and by proxy Tantra, because Tantra ultimately leads to yoga, these practices are essentially satanic. When the Christian preachers rail against yoga, saying that it is of the devil, that it is satanic, and that Christians should not engage in it, they are right. Yoga is satanic. Yoga is a magical system that is explicitly directed towards self-realization.

When we hail Satan properly, we are hailing the self, we are hailing human potential, and we are hailing beauty. We are not hailing evil. Because the Satanist understands non-duality and recognizes that there is no such thing as good or evil. The Satanist exists beyond that which is good and evil.

## Vyaghra Yoga: The Tiger's Path

Vyaghra Yoga is a new system of Left Hand Path yoga. Within Vyaghra Yoga, the true expression of the Left Hand Path is given: immanence, expression of the ego into eternity.

This is Left Hand Path practice where we reject the idea of the foundational monistic self as being the true self. Instead, we recognize our own individuated consciousness as the true self, the self that is to be affirmed against the will of that foundational void. We reject a return to the void. We seek the preservation of immanence.

Ride the Tiger Yoga is utterly opposed to pure transcendence. We are not offering all paths. We are offering this path: immanence, where we preserve the ego against the onslaught of transcendent-oriented systems.

When I say become like a God, I mean that when you live right now within the cycle of death and rebirth, you are in a closed system, a loop that moves from the Satya Yuga to the Treta Yuga, the Dvapara Yuga, and the Kali Yuga. And within that loop, you experience changes in your consciousness. And in order to escape, in order to break free, you must become more powerful than that closed system. You must develop the ego.

The ego is simply individuated consciousness. At the monistic point of the cosmos, when all things are one, there is not individuated consciousness. There is one ego, the ego of the void. When this is broken, when you have the flood, when shakti enters the cosmos and you have a separation of things, this is when the one consciousness becomes many.

The ego, properly understood, is not an illusion to be destroyed but individuated divine consciousness. And its full expression is the counterbalance to pure transcendence, restoring balance to the cosmos.

Ultimate immanence consists of the expression of the ego beyond the cycle of time, beyond the gods, beyond all.

## The Eternal Return

Many people think that Nietzsche was referring to an actual vulgar repetition of life over and over again. But what Nietzsche was really referring to is a reflection on the self. Because when you move from a finite system to an infinite system and your ego is expressed in eternity, you must live with yourself for all time.

You must cultivate the ego in such a way that you can live with yourself for eternity. Most cannot. Most would flee from themselves within the first hour.

The will to power, what we seek on the left hand path: Nietzsche said that you have to be willing to accept as much pain as the pleasure that you seek. If you do not give yourself fully to expression at least one time in your life, you will not know what is there. You cannot fully realize the self, and that requires great risk.

Amor fati. The love of fate. For Nietzsche, Greek tragedy provided the cultural technology for this affirmation. The essential question was how to overcome pessimism through the embrace of suffering and passion. The Greeks faced nihilism at the dawn of contemplative culture. And so in order to address this nihilism, it became necessary to reflect upon the nature of suffering and find some deeper meaning in that suffering.

Dionysus is the dirt and Apollo is the clear water. Combine them, you have a beautiful expression of art that is beyond good and evil. In order to exist in this individuated form, experience life, we have to accept some aspect of chaos. We have to accept both Dionysus and Apollo. And that means we have to be willing to make mistakes.

## Might Makes Right

This is the true law of the cosmos: might makes right.

You have no rights that are granted to you by God. That is a myth. It is a fantasy. Those rights that you claim were given to you by God, they only carry so much power as your belief in them and your willingness to defend them.

If you are one man surrounded by a hundred who decide they want what is yours, try telling them God gave you a right to keep it. See how far that goes. These rights are not granted by anything. They are taken. If you want to have a right to anything, you have to be willing to fight and die to keep it.

What is might? Might is the ability to apply willpower in order to achieve something. Someone is mighty if they are able to decide to take an action and then the action is carried out. That is might.

Might can come from many places. Might can come from the mind. Might can come from the spirit, from emotions, from raw physicality. There are many sources of might. You can be a scrawny computer nerd. But if you have the ability to use your mind to place yourself in a social container where you can express your will and get power, then that makes you mighty.

The manner in which you become strong should be in relation to your dharma.

Anyone who fears having what is theirs taken—their territory, their beloved, their power—must realize this: if you are held back by morality, caring about whether you are good or evil, you have already cut your legs out from underneath you. You have already destroyed your chances of winning in the end.

Because someone is going to come along who does not have those hang ups. Someone is going to come along who does not care about the morality of what they are doing. And they are going to take those things from you. And when they do it, they have done nothing wrong, morally speaking. Maybe they have acted adharmically, but in terms of good and evil, there is no good and evil.

## The Aghori Path

The Aghori tradition is that which is beyond terrible.

We are all born as Aghori. When you are a child, when you are a baby, you play with filth. You show no discrimination. You show no fear. You have no fear of death because you have no concept of death. These things are introduced to you as you begin to experience the world, as you are taught to fear these things, as you are taught to see a difference between filth and cleanliness.

But that does not mean that we are born powerful, because the condition that we exist within upon birth is an unrefined condition, unrefined aspects of shakti. And so if you want to reach your fullest potential, you must begin to discriminate. Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending upon your perspective, the discrimination that you apply creates separation between you and God.

And in fact, the greatest separation between the self and God is the individuated form. It is flesh and blood, which is an aspect of the muladhara. Your skin is a border. It is a protective border that keeps bacteria and other poisons from entering into your body. So it preserves the self. But simultaneously, it acts as a border to unification. It acts as a barrier to the realization of God consciousness.

So what must be done? Well, the border has to be dissolved. But of course, if you are dissolving that which protects you from the poisons of this earth, you are placing yourself in great danger. And this is why so many of those who become aghoris fail to reach their ultimate potential. Because just one bad decision can lead to such a great dissolution of physical form that you cannot possibly recover.

The Aghoris consume flesh. They partake in the poisons. The meat that they take from a human body, that is the meat of God. A common practice is for an Aghori to sit in front of a burning body on a cremation pyre and watch the skull begin to build pressure. And then watch as the crown of the skull pops, explodes, and the brain falls out from the skull, and they scurry over to the brain, they pick it up and they eat it.

This is an application of their will to recognize that all things are divine. But also, there is another meaning to this from a left hand perspective. If you are trying to become physically powerful, if you are trying to embrace shakti, you want to consume things that give you power. When you consume the deer, you gain the power of the deer. When you consume human flesh, you gain the power of man. Man is a powerful animal.

## The Goal: To Become a God

When you die, you will cross over into a new dimension of consciousness. And when you do this, there will be a question of whether or not the things that you are experiencing in this new dimension are illusion.

To know the self, to know each aspect of consciousness, to understand the chakras, and to be able to recognize the consciousness of those things that are precious to you will allow you to confidently say that your unification with your loved one or loved ones in this new plane of existence is not an illusion. It is real. You have succeeded in achieving immortality with awareness.

That awareness is great power. It is the greatest power. It is the ability to achieve godhood.

And that is the goal of the Aghori. To become a God.

Satanic consciousness may be attained through the practice of Tantra. It is the exploration of the chakras on the ascending and descending paths that allows for the total realization of superconsciousness. Indulgence provides the key for the elevation of differentiated form into an eternal expression.

Godhood.

On a Right Hand Path initiation, that is what we are seeking. We are seeking that condition of ego death. We want to experience death. But if we want to walk the Left Hand Path, we want to come back. If we want to achieve deification of the Atman, if we want the individuated self, if we want to become a God, we have to come back.

Reincarnation.

This is Vyaghra Yoga. The tiger's path. The Black Sun. The condition of Satan.

To spread. To continue. To cover. To become.

The Left Hand Path begins when you are reborn.
