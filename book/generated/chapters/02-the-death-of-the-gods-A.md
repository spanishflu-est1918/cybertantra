# Chapter 2: The Death of the Gods

## The Pattern of Divine Decadence

Although Indra rules as a great king for a very, very long time, he too becomes hedonistic. He falls to attachment. Instead of providing the people with the proper amount of rain to grow their crops, to live with prosperity, Indra becomes violent towards the people. He terrifies them. He is so full of inner fire. His raging storm continues on and on and on. And he loses his orderly aspect. He loses connection to his dharma.

This is the king who no longer serves. When those on high change the rules, when the poor can no longer find prosperity, you have great resentment—resentment that builds toward revolution.

Indra lost his position as chief of the gods because just as Yahweh became decadent, Indra also became decadent. But rather than a massive cult forming around Indra, preserving his power, there was a shift away from Indra and new gods were formed. This was the death of the gods. This was Ragnarök.

## Ragnarök: The Universal Pattern

The fall of Indra and Ragnarök represent the same cosmic phenomenon—the death of gods who have become decadent and lost connection to their dharma. Zeus, Indra, Odin, Yahweh—these are all aspects of the storm. They all carry a similar energetic nature. It's the same line of music being played on different cultural instruments.

But instruments can fall out of tune. Gods can lose their way.

Indra is an honorific, a title—there are many Indras. The position can be renewed. What matters is whether the tradition allows for death and rebirth, or whether it freezes its gods in their decadent state.

## Two Responses to Divine Decay

Here we find a crucial divergence between traditions.

### In India: Renewal

After Indra's fall, you had the rise of Shiva, Shakti, Vishnu. These are new gods. These are the Tantric gods. This is the living expression of the Aryan spirituality that has been made manifest within new symbols, within the elevation of the divine feminine Shakti.

The Aghoric and Tantric traditions represent lineages that maintained the living quality of the gods, allowing for death and rebirth rather than frozen worship of corrupted forms.

### In Europe: Calcification

This shift towards a living tradition was suppressed throughout all of Europe. In Scandinavia, you did not have the rise of a Tantric system because the influence of Christianity led to a full embrace of the divine masculine aspect, the solar aspect, the worship of Yahweh in the form of Odin.

The gods became frozen, preserved in their decadent state rather than allowed to transform.

Consider the Mughal invasions: the Brahmin priests became outcasts, the untouchables, when his head has been cut off and he's been replaced by a man who is teaching you to prostrate yourself to Allah. That is a total dissolution of caste. That is Ragnarök.

## The Structural Flaw of Abrahamism

Yahweh convinced the Jews to throw out the rest of the pantheon, including Yahweh's consort. There was no longer a spiritual balance within the system. There was no longer the interplay between the masculine and the feminine. The divine masculine became entirely dominant.

This created what we call the monotheistic mind virus. Everything has to be held to one specific standard. And if you do not agree with that, you're the infidel. You have to be eliminated.

The foundation of that expression of consciousness is one that creates shame, it creates outrage, it creates reactivity. Why is AI woke? Because the Jewish God is woke. The Christian God is woke. The Islamic God is woke.

## The Bloated Corpse

Abrahamism as it exists now is in its ultimate state of decadence. It is a bloated corpse at this point. And we can see the rot all around us.

Less and less younger people are believing in this Abrahamic system. They're moving towards—whether it's witchcraft or it's yoga—these older sciences that make sense.

What happens when Vishnu becomes decadent? That is what is occurring within the Indian tradition. The preserver is the one who has reached a point of poison. The Vaishnava tradition has become obsessed with dogma, moralistic dogma. The preserver function calcifying into rigid moralism rather than living dharma.

Ultimately Christianity is nihilistic, and so that nihilism is what really reigns supreme.

## The Atheist Trap

What about the atheist? Well, there are some who just throw their hands in the air and they say, okay, I'm not going to be an adversary. But I'm just going to say that the gods don't exist and God doesn't exist. Well, all you've done at that point is you have undercut your ability to access the full expression of your consciousness. And so you're neutered. You are rendered impotent against the system.

When you embrace that perspective, you are ultimately playing right into the hand of the monotheistic system. Because monotheism leads back to the cosmic egg. It leads back to the monistic point, the place without differentiation, the ultimate nothingness, the blackness.

The vacuum created by God's death doesn't lead to liberation—it leads to the very foundation the cabal operates from: pure nothingness, infinite death.

Those who just throw their hands in the air and become apathetic to the whole thing—they're not directing their karma in any meaningful way. And so they are submitting their will, they're giving up their autonomy. They become part of the deterministic order of the divine masculine.

Many atheists will even say, oh, Jesus Christ, I don't believe that he was God, but I believe he was a great moral teacher. You don't have to be religious. You don't have to be a Christian or a Muslim or a Jew to accept Abrahamic morality. Many secularists accept the standards of Abrahamic morality. Even if they don't believe in an objective standard of morality, they will still attempt to recognize the Abrahamic condition of morality as being superior.

Ayn Rand was an atheist because she was so fiercely Vaishya and she did not have a balancing point. She fully embraced the extremity of the Vaishya, which is secularism. She embraced the self. The self becomes God without reference to spirit. Ayn Rand rejected Nietzsche's conception of the Übermensch because she believed that it was too spiritual, it was too metaphysical, too supernatural.

She missed the point entirely.

## Nietzsche's Diagnosis

Nietzsche was obsessed with the essential element of the anahata, which is willpower. He was also very concerned with balance. His goal in works like *The Birth of Tragedy* was to identify the source of the growing pessimism and nihilism within modernity and offer a solution to that pessimism and nihilism.

Nietzsche saw the problem originating with Socrates and the rise of Western philosophy—the death of tragedy and the rise of Socrates. Everything follows from that point within the present Visuddhi age.

He recognized a lack of irrational passion within the culture. Things had become far too reasonable. The rise of scientific thought and the rise of philosophy had created a cooling.

Nietzsche's proposed solution was not atheistic nihilism but rather a return to tragedy, or from a tantric perspective, a return to the age of the Anahata.

## What Fills the Void

The void isn't something to be filled—it's something to be transmuted.

The African magical tradition offers a fascinating alternative—an almost atheistic approach that nonetheless recognizes full divinity: It's not as if they say that God doesn't exist, it's just that they say that God is with them all the time. God is the land, God is the idol, God is the fetish. Here, the transcendent God dies but divinity is relocated into the material, the immediate, the present.

The Seeker strives for what is at the core of the self: Dharma. And in finding Dharma, the truth becomes high, low, and in between.

To know the cosmos, you must know the highest highs and the lowest lows. You must live and die at once.

The Bhairavi is a necromancer. Her devotees collect bodies and use them as platforms. These bodies become vehicles for new power. The emptiness of the cosmic womb is not escaped but embraced and worked with—death becomes the ground for new creation.

## The Birth of New Gods

We're coming to a point in time when the old gods, the old traditions, have been so corrupted and transformed into part of this dream that we're going to have to give birth to new gods at some point. Yes, it will be the same essential essence, of course, of the gods of the past. But there will be new gods that will be reflective of the condition that we're facing now.

Through these practices that all of us will have access to self-deification—to become a God in this new realm. And not just in cyberspace, but in all space, in every dimension. We can recognize the individuated divinity of polytheism and no longer be confined to submission to the tyrannical dictate of the state.

Through Tantra, we can create gods that are beautiful, gods that give us something worth living for.

Even though Indra has been diminished, this is not a condition that can be maintained. This is a condition that can change. Any of the Christian influence on the Germanic tradition can be completely uprooted and thrown away. We can repair these traditions. We can recognize that the gods are still alive. We can commune with them, we can work with them. And through experimentation and direct experience, we can see that the kings of old rise again.

We do not have to see the rise of global communism. Instead, what we can see is the rise of pagan imperialism once again taking the entire earth by storm—

And maybe seeing the gods walk on this earth again.
