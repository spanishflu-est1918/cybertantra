# Chapter 3: The Prison of Modernity

## The Spirit as Whisper

In the Kali Yuga, the spirit is a whisper in the howling wind.

The Kali Yuga represents the point at which Kali is fully awake and her power can be experienced in its fullest expression. She produces the material world through objectification that separates certain elements from oneness. Oneness is the source of all spiritual experience, and the separation of oneness into various objects is a destructive process that causes the spirit to progressively retreat to the subtle expression. The spiritual is supplanted by the material in terms of degree of perceptibility. While spirit consciousness is experienced directly in the Satya Yuga, this consciousness becomes increasingly elusive, until the recognition of spiritual consciousness becomes incredibly rare.

The oneness of the Satya Yuga is broken by Kali, and the material body that existed only as a possibility in the Satya Yuga eventually becomes the dominant form. As the Kali Yuga advances, the extremity of differentiation increases, often beyond the average person's capacity to bear.

We exist now in the global civilizational age of the Vishuddhi. Though the present civilizational age began in a well-adjusted form, the process of degeneration has led to the manifestation of numerous maladjustments. It looks like social isolation, alienation, depression, anxiety, solipsism, radical skepticism, nihilism. This is the defining matrix of the contemporary manifestation of the global civilization, of modernity.

## The Wheelchair of the Mind

Within the present age of modernity, which is the age of the Vishuddhi, there is a strong emphasis on the mind. And because of that, the alchemical aspect of air is prevalent, very prevalent. What we have now is a very intense focus on the mind. And this intense focus on the mind creates maladjustment.

In modernity, much of the thinking, much of the introspecting that occurs, occurs outside of the self. Society is always telling people what to think, and they are always telling people what exists within their mind, what mental matrices exist inside of each individual. When you watch television, when you watch the news, when you consume any kind of media in any way, much of the media that is produced now is designed specifically to do all of your thinking for you.

In the past, artistic creations were very challenging. Mythology challenged the people. Great productions of Greek tragedy challenged the people. Great novels, classic novels were very challenging. The media that individuals interacted with presented them with something to chew on. There was an encouraging aspect to this. It was like: I am opening this door, I am inviting you to experience the mind, but you have to bring something to the experience.

Now, as we get deeper into modernity, people are spoon-fed ideas. Film, television, novels, the stage, all of this is designed to be as immediately perceptible as possible. When individuals interact with this media, all they really have to do is show up, then absorb whatever is being given to them. And because of this, the mind is handicapped.

In this present stage of modernity, it is as if everyone is born and then immediately placed into a wheelchair. Just imagine what that would do to the physical body if you were to be born and immediately placed into a wheelchair. There would be no reason for your body to develop muscles, to develop a healthy skeletal structure. Your body would atrophy, it would wither away and you would be weakened, physically weakened, by the experience of immediately being placed in a wheelchair upon birth.

If we started putting babies in wheelchairs as soon as they were born, and not giving them the chance to crawl, to learn to walk, to learn to run, to learn to jump and climb and advance, everyone would think this is insane. But this is exactly what we do to the mind in modernity. As soon as you are born, you are told exactly what to think. You are read books that tell you what to think. You are placed in an institutional learning facility where you are taught exactly what to think and how to think it. You go to college, same thing. Or maybe you do not go to college, but if you do not go to college, it does not matter because everyone around you is going to tell you exactly what you need to think, and the wider culture is going to try to shove ideas down your throat.

Very rarely will you be presented with an idea by a confident thinker who is willing to honestly present you with the idea and say, take it or leave it. Because very few people have confidence in the quality of the ideas that they are expressing in the current age. These individuals who present you with an idea have to brainwash you. Instead of being able to present a poignant idea in a few words or in a short presentation, they have to write a nine hundred page book on a simple subject that could be summed up concisely. But if you present your ideas concisely and clearly, you are asking people to engage with the raw presentation of your ideas. You are not watering those ideas down, you are not sugarcoating your ideas, you are just presenting them. And then people have to chew on those ideas. And those raw ideas that are really meaningful are challenging and difficult for people to engage with. Because of that, those ideas struggle in the marketplace of ideas. Because the Shudra wants something that is easy to digest, the Shudra want to be brainwashed, they desire programming.

You can see this in academia because so many learned scholars within academia live for the two thousand page magnum opus from the latest obscure Marxist. They live for that because it allows them to undergo the process of willful programming. Because they were placed in an intellectual wheelchair when they were born, it feels good to them to have everything injected, manipulated, twisted into their mind. Because to interact with a difficult idea would require standing up from that intellectual wheelchair. And most people are not willing to feel their legs shake, feel their bones quake and feel the ground fall out from underneath them.

## The Maladjusted Mind

If you possess a weak mind and someone presents some insanity to you, something that has no connection to reality whatsoever, are you going to be able to recognize the fact that this idea is not grounded in reality? No, you are not going to be able to recognize that idea because you do not possess a grounded point. You do not have enough strength in the mind to pull yourself down to a place where you can apply reason in a healthy fashion.

All of the maladjustments within the Vishuddhi ultimately come back to sloth. Sloth is the sin that is associated with the Vishuddhi. Sloth has many different manifestations and many of these manifestations are only very subtly connected with sloth. But energetically there is a connection.

The strength of the maladjusted Vishuddhi culture is such that most people who try to break free from the mundane are immediately trapped within the mind. This is the construct.

There is something about the Vishuddhi: when people enter in the Vishuddhi, they start to believe that everything is of the mind. The reason is because the Vishuddhi is the point of introspection. The introspective nature of the Vishuddhi is interesting because it is the only aspect of consciousness that is entirely internalized. When you operate from a rooted point in the mind, there is a tendency to feel a great internalization of everything. The extreme manifestation of this is to become totally internalized, to become a hermit, which is a common maladjustment of individuals rooted in the Vishuddhi.

Within modernity there is a tendency to become isolated. And isolation is something that can occur to anyone who has an overstimulated mind. The feeling of sound, light, sensation becoming a disturbance of the mind. This occurs within the Vishuddhi because when you become increasingly introspective, the outside world becomes intolerable.

in the mild cases of this, you might just begin to think that your ideas are the only ideas that matter and you create this intellectual arrogance. The new atheist movement is full of this kind of maladjustment in the Vishuddhi, where people believe they have the answers to everything. And they want to tell you that this is the way the universe is, and there is no arguing with it. That is the kind of intellectual arrogance that is generated in a maladjusted aspect of the Vishuddhi.

What happens is when you become increasingly introspective, you feel like you are detached from the outside world, you are the only thing that really matters. And it goes from "I am the only thing that really matters" to "I am the only thing that really exists." That is when you get into dangerous territory. That is when you get into the really intense existential crisis, the existential nausea that permeates much of modernity, and feeling like you cannot trust anything. That is when the radical skepticism sets in. And the radical skepticism is what leads to things like mass atheism.

## The Disease of Nihilism

Nihilism, even when it is not expressed in its purest form, is an energetic disease of the mind that permeates the global culture. It is important that all yogins understand that nihilism is not just an idea. It is a state of consciousness that manifests as a maladjustment of the Vishuddhi. You can catch the disease of nihilism by surrounding yourself with expressions of the diseased mind.

Modern science has failed to give humanity any source of meaning and understanding and awareness that adds to the beauty of life. It has reduced everything to nihilism and solipsism. That is the end goal of science.

This is the beginning of nihilism within European culture: the point at which we are advancing from an action-oriented world to a contemplative world. Within this contemplative world, there is this sudden realization of the meaninglessness of life.

The end of the Greek tragedy is marked by the rise of Socrates and Euripides, because Euripides took a different approach where he emphasized the dialogue over the chorus and often would abandon the chorus entirely. His emphasis was on reason, the presentation of a logical argument in the art form. And this coincided with the rise of philosophy. Philosophy is a major shift away from the original means by which humanity assessed the nature of the cosmos. Prior to the rise of philosophy, systems that recognized the presence of a holistic expression of the cosmos were the dominant form. All of the great major folk traditions of Europe, Germanic paganism, Hellenism, the Indian tradition of Sanatana Dharma, these are not philosophical systems. These are systems that recognize the presence of all of the various elements of the cosmos, and they do not emphasize one element over the other. There is this natural balance.

With the rise of philosophy, you have a drastic shift towards the mind. The application of reason is regarded as the ultimate expression of a search for truth and understanding. And everything is intellectualized. Myth becomes less of a living tradition and turns into the science of archetypes. the gods lose their essence, they lose their reality. They are no longer active within the culture. Now what you have is the mind elevated to the primary position of understanding.

If you want to identify the absolute beginning of modernity, this is the death of tragedy and the rise of Socrates and Western philosophy. Everything follows from that point within the present Vishuddhi age.

## The Extinguishing of Fire

Everyone who is born rooted in the Manipura is by their very nature adversarial to the prevailing age. Therefore, these individuals are natural social outcasts. More so than any other expression of consciousness. The Manipura in the present age, in modernity, is unacceptable socially. We can see how society is structured in such a way where expressions of the Manipura are discouraged and expressions of the adversarial aspect of the Vishuddhi are encouraged.

When people speak of the problem of modernity and rejection of modernity, for the most part what they are instinctually rebelling against is the maladjusted aspect of the mind. And what they are seeking for the most part is reintegration of the fire, of the spark, of the flame, of creativity.

Essentially what occurred was a move towards focusing on the mind as the center of consciousness and stripping away the holistic expression of consciousness outside of the mind. Education in the Greco-Roman world was centered around cultivation of the physical body. You would spend a lot of time cultivating your body and integrating with the creative fire, the inner fire.

you wonder why there is this decline in creativity in our contemporary age, why art just seems to be getting worse and worse and worse. There are fewer creative people in the world, and expressions of art just seem to lack that creative spark. The culture seems to lack a creative spark. Everything is just shit in terms of artistic expression. Why is that? Because you took all the naturally creative people and you shoved them into their minds and you told them to go to college and you told them to be academics instead of pursuing their natural, emotional, artistic expression. And that is why people have forgotten how to laugh. That is why people are stuck in this radical skepticism. That is why art sucks for the most part, because it is not just the Manipura people who suffer from this, it is everybody else. We all struggle to connect with our inner fire because all of us are encouraged to abandon that aspect of the self.

## The Institution of Conformity

The goal of treatment for these so-called mental illnesses is to flatten the emotions and turn everyone into a maladjusted Vishuddhi person. Because the wider civilizational age establishes standards of proper conduct, of behavior. Everyone must conform; that is the nature of a social order. If you have this arm of the civilization that exists to uphold the law, uphold the standard of behavior, which is modern psychology, and you have institutions that are formed in order to punish those who do not conform to the prevailing order, what you have is a complete infection of everyone and everything with the same disease, the disease of modernity.

Put in a desk from the time you are five years old until you are eighteen. Shut your mouth. Watch the teacher. If you divert attention, they give you a pill.

There is a great psychological, spiritual trauma from the Industrial Revolution that has not been reconciled. And the conditions of political economy within the west, they remain influenced by this endless march of progression, which began with the Abrahamic Revolution and was worsened greatly by the Protestant revolution. Because the Protestant work ethic is the foundation of this technological advancement.

The people of the countryside were convinced en masse to abandon the life that they lived and enter into a new dimension. And that is what it was, a new realm of life where the simplicity of the countryside was abandoned for the confinement of the factory. This required unprecedented mass propaganda from church, state, and media working in concert with industrial interests. The industrialists controlled political power, they controlled the economy, they were in alignment with the usurers. And so the entire system was directed towards the embrace of the new God, the God of progress, the God of endless technological development.

This progression that ramps up from year to year continues to go faster and faster. People having to work harder, run to and fro, and never have time for self-reflection.

## The Matrix of Reactivity

When compelled, you will take action. When horny, you will masturbate. When sad, you will drink and sulk. When angry, you will lash out. This is because you live in a state of unrefined Shakti.

If you can stay in this state, you are going to be easily controlled. You are in a reactive state. When they shove the advertising in your face that is supposed to entice you, you are going to react to it immediately, and you will be drawn into their world, and you will live by their standards.

Most of us do not hunt every day in order to secure our livelihood. Instead, we are forced to enter into a one-pointed state. And this encourages reactivity. And of course, this is beneficial to those who control the system, because those who control the system want you to be reactive.

Reactive rejection is still reactivity. When the federal government tells you to take a vaccine and your opinion of the federal government is that everyone involved in the system is full of shit, then your reaction is going to be, no, fuck that. But of course, we are talking about reactive behavior. We are not talking about indulgent behavior. This is compulsion. You are controlled whether you compulsively accept or compulsively reject.

Why does that Coca Cola commercial make me horny? What are they doing to my brain? What is going on here? Why did my doctor give me this pill and tell me I need to cool it and take this pill every day so I can feel happy?

Compulsion means you do not have a choice. Indulgence means you choose. You regain your humanity. You are able to express your will and you are free from a state of reactivity.

## The Destination of Nothingness

What is nothingness? It is the foundation of the cabal. It is the foundation of the Western tradition. It is death, total death, infinite death. That is what you are leading your life towards when you embrace that perspective.

The atheist who anticipates nothingness after death has, paradoxically, already aligned with the system's ultimate aim. They have simply arrived at the destination through a different door. All they have done at that point is undercut their ability to access the full expression of their consciousness. And so they are neutered. They are rendered impotent against the system. They are not directing their karma in any meaningful way. And so they are submitting their will, they are giving up their autonomy. They become part of the deterministic order of the divine masculine.

Literally everything that you have been consuming, all the popular media, all the spiritualism you have been getting from the New Age, from Christianity, from pretty much anything except the dharmic paths, everything has been steering you towards this life, this system life. You would not even know what to do with the time if you had it.

The system can literally design a type of human that they want to create. And they can create a consumer culture that allows them to stamp out copies of that human type over and over again based upon whatever is being fed to the people. That is not just in regards to their diet, but anything they consume: media, television, YouTube videos, music. All of these things can be used to create and stamp out clones of a given human type and create an entire civilization of slaves.

## The Assault on Eternal Existence

Any attempt to suppress the expression of your Dharma is an attempt to destroy your personality for eternity, so that the personhood that you cultivate in this life has no chance to continue beyond. You have no chance to leave this world and walk with the gods with your personhood intact.

The core of who you are, your Dharma, is still there. The shell may wither, but the essential self persists, waiting for expression. But if you die in a suppressed state, that core of your Dharma will go on to take rebirth in a new form. And you will lose the personality that you possess in this life. Because it went undeveloped. You are unaware of this personality. It went unexpressed.

This is a direct attack on your ability to continue to exist in the cosmos.

## The First Step

It may therefore be stated that the first step of yoga is to reject the prevailing age and recognize its traps.

If you cannot escape this mind trap, you cannot perform Tantra, you cannot perform yoga, and you cannot fully grasp any of the things that are taught within this school.

Those who many people consider to be intellectuals, they are these pathetic little wimps, these maladjusted Vishuddhi people who refuse to exercise their body, who refuse to engage with their emotions, who take pills to stifle their emotional expression, who do not care about the spirit except maybe going to church every once in a while. What they do is they just exist within this atrophied mind space. And it is hilarious to call them intellectuals, but they are highly intellectual. It is just, they are not smart, they are not wise. If you are highly intellectual, that does not guarantee that you are going to be a wise person.

We need to break that dogma right now. And another dogma that needs to be thrown aside is the idea that everyone who is naturally intellectual has to be a pathetic scrawny son of a bitch, or a fat-ass neckbeard who sits on 4chan all day long. We need to get rid of that idea. This idea that if you are an intellectual person, you should just sit around in total sloth and play video games all day long. It is ridiculous. And it is so broken and so disconnected from tradition.

Because here is what is so funny about it: people who are rooted in the Vishuddhi are supposed to be the natural warriors of a culture. The Vishuddhi is the place of chivalry, knighthood, bushido, the samurai. It is the place of the law, the word, the order that is upheld by the sword. With the sword, you uphold the law, the word, the mental matrix. You cut through the bullshit and establish grounding in the mind. And with the sword, you make your intellectual point and you stand by it.

All of those neckbeards you see in Gamestop, they are supposed to be knights. All of those Ichabod Crane-looking motherfuckers in universities all throughout the globe, they are supposed to be samurai, but instead they are ronin. They are masterless samurais because they do not have a system that is worthy of upholding, they do not have a king worthy of following. And because they lack a society that is worthy of defending, what do they do? Their armor rusts, their sword dulls and their bodies atrophy and their mind atrophies. And they seek out stimulation of the mind in surrogate activities like video games. The reason why video games are so popular is because these men and women who are supposed to be knightly people need adventure. They need to feel like they are accomplishing something. They interact with these fantasy worlds that create conditions that they wish they could see around them, but unfortunately do not exist in the wider culture.

## Riding the Tiger

An assessment of the predictions of the Bhagavata Purana in reference to contemporary society reveals an accurate description of the destructive aspects of humanity in the Kali Yuga. Despite this, one must consider the great power and beauty that may be gained by those who successfully ride the tiger during these trying times.

In the Kali Yuga, the yogi endures pain for pleasure and suffers for beauty. The suffering of asceticism is endured to gain greater power. This is the nature of Tantra.

It is within the right hand path that Yogins step out of the wheelchair. They stand up from the intellectual wheelchair and they take command over their mind and they hone their mind and they establish autonomy within the mind and they say: no longer will I allow you to spoon-feed me information. I am going to willfully engage with ideas that are scary, that are challenging. I am going to place my mind in conditions where I can test the strength of it and I can grow, I can flex my head. That is what we do on the right hand path with the Vishuddhi.

This is a revolutionary idea within the current age. Because the system does not want you to think. The system does not want you to flex your head. It wants you to remain in your intellectual wheelchair. Because the second that you take control over your mind, that is the moment when you start to entertain those ideas that become a threat to the system.

Kali is the barbarian at the gate. She is the raw force of nature that reminds everyone that if we become too civilized, we will be crushed. We must draw ourselves towards the dark drums in the jungle of Kali, those dark, barbarous sides of ourselves that civilization would ask us to shun. But if we can embrace those things strongly and if we can recognize this growing cult of Kali as a potential to access the rising sun within us and draw down power from the moon, then we can know the secrets of Kali and we can gain her favor, her power, her love and beauty.

Yet there is more than escape from this prison. There is a destination. Beyond the Vishuddhi lies the Ajna, the third eye, where mind touches spirit. And we stand now at the threshold of a new age.
