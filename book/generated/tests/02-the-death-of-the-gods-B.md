# Chapter 2: The Usurper and the Eclipse

## The Absurdity of the Lawgiver

Consider the god who judges. Consider any god who looks upon the cosmos and declares: this is right, this is wrong, and I have the final say. That god has taken an action.

Praxiology teaches us that no intelligent being takes action unless there is unfulfilled desire. If all desires are fulfilled, there is no need for action. The god who passes judgment, who applies a standard of objective morality to all things within the cosmos, has revealed himself to be incomplete. He possesses unfulfilled desire. He is not omnipotent. He is not the primordial oneness from which authority could legitimately flow.

Any aspect of primordial oneness that engages in interaction must also exist with the opposing force of differentiation. But a god who passes judgment is taking an action, and therefore that god has shown itself to be something other than what it claims to be. The entire system of dualistic morality depends upon the lawgiver. The authority of the lawgiver depends upon his status as an essential being. If that status collapses, the entire edifice of good and evil falls with it.

This is the praxiological argument against dualistic morality. The absurdity of objective good and evil, as represented within the Abrahamic tradition, can be demonstrated through pure logic.

## The Ascent of the Patriarch

Yahweh was once a god among gods. Within the ancient Jewish tradition, he assumed the role of the sky father, the patriarchal storm god, the same essential role as Jupiter in Rome, as Zeus in Greece, as Indra in India, as Odin among the Germanic peoples. These patriarchal storm gods share essential energetic expression. They play the same role within their respective pantheons. They are nevertheless individual beings with their own personalities.

The transformation occurred in Babylon. When the Jews were enslaved, the cult of Yahweh was presented as a path toward liberation. The idea formed that if the Jewish people could give all of their energy to Yahweh, if they could elevate him to the position of the one true god, they would be liberated. They would become the chosen ones. A prophecy would form that would grant them the position of master.

The elevation succeeded. The polytheistic faith became monotheistic. And in this transformation, something extraordinary occurred: Yahweh took the name of El.

El is the primordial father within the Jewish tradition. El is Saturn. El is the monistic point, equivalent to Brahma, to Ymir, to Kronos. But there is an energetic difference between El as primordial oneness and Yahweh wearing the title of El. The original El does not possess the active, conquering personality that Yahweh displays. El is transcendent. Yahweh, even cloaked in transcendent garb, remains an imminent conquering spirit. He was able to destroy the rest of his pantheon and assume power. The cult of Yahweh became the dominant cult in the world.

## The Natural Cycle Arrested

In all Aryan traditions, the story follows the same pattern. A king rises. He becomes the new sky father. He reigns well for a time. Then he grows decadent. Then comes a usurper, and the cycle continues.

In the Germanic tradition, Odin conquered Ymir. He guided the carving of the primordial giant's body into the material cosmos. He reigned. But in the myths, Loki rises against Odin. Ragnarok comes. Mass destruction, then rebirth. New gods rise.

In the Arthurian tales, Arthur is usurped by Mordred. A Ragnarok event. Death, then renewal.

This endless cycle defines the Aryan traditions. A king rises, becomes decadent, falls to a usurper. On and on through the tradition.

There is one way for the sky father to prevent the loss of his throne: elevate himself to the point of monotheistic worship. Absorb all competitors into himself. Declare himself the only god. This is what Yahweh achieved.

Yet even this did not stop the cycle. Even though Yahweh reached the point of monotheism, a new usurper rose out of that tradition. Perhaps the most powerful usurper in any tradition. Lucifer rises to face Yahweh.

## The Vacuum of Meaning

When Nietzsche wrote The Birth of Tragedy, he was addressing the growing pessimism and nihilism of modernity. The Greek tragedy had represented the balance of divine masculine and divine feminine: Apollo and Dionysus, form and chaos, dialogue and chorus. The dialogue carried the story; the chorus drew in myth, passion, the irrational depths.

Then Socrates came, and Euripides. They emphasized reason over revelation, dialogue over chorus. The Dionysian element was suppressed. Philosophy rose. Everything became intellectualized. Myth ceased to be a living tradition and became the science of archetypes. The gods lost their essence, their reality. They were no longer active within the culture.

This is the origin of modernity. The death of tragedy, the rise of Western philosophy. Everything follows from that point. Nietzsche saw it as a catastrophe. The cooling effect of scientific thought and philosophy prevented the heroic expression that allows humans to understand the role of suffering in life. For Nietzsche, suffering is the platform for a rise to greatness. Without the capacity to reflect on suffering through both reason and passion, meaning drains from the world.

The vacuum was never filled. Abrahamism offered its answer: submit to the lawgiver, and the lawgiver will grant meaning. But this is the petty moralism of objective good and evil, not the complex system of karma that recognizes conditional aspects, dharmic expression, the nature of the individual. In karma, action and consequence are examined in relation to the individual's nature. What accumulates good or bad karma depends upon the conditions, upon the dharma being pursued.

Good and evil as absolutes are absurdity. Karma is something else entirely. But karma too becomes an attachment that must eventually be released.

## The Systems of Binding

The systems that surround us are binding rituals. Marriage as legalistic contract severs the connection with the gods. It binds the divine feminine into submission and places the divine masculine in a degenerated position of false authority. Usury and the banking system hold people in bondage to the will of the system. The political system is another binding ritual: when you vote, you give your prana to the church of the political order. Fiat money is Vishuddhi magic, the creation of a matrix of ideas that holds power only as long as people agree to play pretend.

To escape the power of Yahweh requires total rejection of the law. Not selective rejection, not reform from within. There is no good and evil in the absolute sense. There is only what is dharmic or adharmic, what serves your nature or what violates it.

The Abrahamic god comes to people at their lowest moment. When someone dies, when you are in your darkest hour, he offers salvation. But this salvation is not elevation. It is a new condition of slavery. A true liberator wants to see you live with no chains, elevated to the condition of brotherhood.

## The Rising Sun

The black sun is the usurper. The solar aspect in divine union with the earth mother. The healthy divine masculine in alignment with the healthy divine feminine. This is the key to defeating the magic of the patriarch gone decadent.

Satan, properly understood, is not a being but a condition. The Sanskrit roots Sat and Tan combine to form Satan: the condition of becoming god. Any individual on a path toward self-realization, whether seeking unification with the godhead or individuated expression beyond time, exists within the condition of Satan. This is not evil. This is the affirmation of life, the affirmation of the will to power, the pursuit of one's dharma to its fullest expression.

To spread one's will beyond god, to cover the sun with one's individuated nature: this is to act as the black sun. The eclipse is the birth of a new sun. When the lunar aspect rises to eclipse the old sun, this grants power to the rising sun to assume sovereignty.

## The Barbarian at the Gate

Kali is the barbarian at the gate. She is the raw force of nature that reminds every civilization: if you become too soft, too civilized, too disconnected from the blood, you will be crushed.

The Aryan traditions begin with the mother cult. The son in rebellion against the aging patriarch gains his power from the mother. Mordred aligns with Morgana against Arthur. The lunar aspect feeds power to the rising sun. But when the patriarch refuses to share power, when the mother is rejected and placed in a bind, decadence sets in.

This is what happened with Brahmanic society. The solar aspect became obsessed with spirit over blood. The common people were forgotten. The connection to the land was severed. And so the Kalikula formed: children of Kali, the cult in absolute rejection of Brahmanic authority. Anti-lineage. Anti-dogma. The preservation of the mother for the time of revolution.

Kali's name carries confusion by design. Kala means either time or blackness, depending on accent. The cultists who followed her, operating outside Brahmanic obsession with precise meaning, allowed the confusion to persist. Through chaos, through disorder, Kali communicates her nature. Time, death, blackness. The threefold blood. The most intense expression of divine femininity concentrated into jaws that rend and tear and bloody civilization so that something new can be created in its ashes.

---

The eclipse approaches. The old sun has grown decadent. The black sun rises.

Somewhere in the jungle, the dark drums of Kali beat. The barbarian stands at the gate, sword in hand, garland of heads around her neck, tongue extended to drink the blood of the tyrant who thought himself eternal.

This is not destruction for its own sake. This is the clearing that precedes new growth. The revolutionary tradition seeks balanced unification between divine masculine and divine feminine. But balance cannot be achieved while the decadent patriarch refuses to share power, while the mother remains in chains, while the systems of binding hold consciousness in bondage.

The wolf age is upon us. Fenrir strains against his fetters. The thimble winter descends.

And then: rebirth.
